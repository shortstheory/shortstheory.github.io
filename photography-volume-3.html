            <p>This is probably the shortest duration between two meaningful posts on this
blog: just eight days! Today also represents the 1st anniversary of this blog,
and hence, I present my new photography album.  </p>
<p>Most of you would have already seen <a href="/photography-volume-2">Volume
2</a> and <a href="/photography">Volume
1</a>, so you probably
have an idea of my photography skills. I can only say that my skills have
improved since then, as you will see in these photos.  </p>
<p>All of these photos were shot in either Aperture Priority (Av) or Shutter
Speed Priority (Tv) modes, a step forward from shooting in  Program (P) mode.
I like exercising full control over the camera, though the camera does a
better job than me in choosing shutter speeds for apertures, so Av is the mode
of choice.  </p>
<p>Technical chatter aside; the photos (click to enlarge):  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/IMG_6748.JPG" style="width: 1600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>Let's start off with this. A rare shot with two animals. I can't offer any
opinion as to why the squirrel didn't run away from there or why the bird
landed there in the first place, but using a wide aperture and high zoom did
wonders here.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/IMG_6770.JPG" style="width: 1600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>Another squirrel? Well, actually it's the same one as in the previous picture.
I'm at the risk of repeating photos over here, but this shot was way too good
to pass up. The dark area which you see to the right of the image actually
gives this photo a subtle effect and the squirrel's pose is fantastic. Using a
digital camera gave me a wide choice of focal lengths without much adjustment.
This one is 929 mm equivalent on a 35 mm film. Used f-stop 5.7 here, because
wider apertures are beyond the camera's potential at these focal lengths.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/IMG_6799.JPG" style="width: 1600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>Pretty nice shot here as well. It looks like a macro shot, but this one was
shot from afar. The sunflower looks great here, and the tiny ladybug on the
petals is the icing on the cake (or should I say flower?). The background was
perfectly suited for this shot, and gives a nice empty space for this photo.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/IMG_6817.JPG" style="width: 1600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>I won't lie to you by saying that this picture was taken at a different
location from the previous one. I like the bee's placement in the flower and
the flower itself. The flies and the varieties of insects that adorn the
flower also look good over here. The background is one of my favourite parts
of this photo, with details blurred to put emphasis on the main flower, but
visible at the same time. It's a hard balance to maintain, but I'm glad that
it worked over here.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/IMG_6972.JPG" style="width: 1600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>Nothing special about the photography techniques over here, but photographing
another creature, and a reptile at that was too good to pass up.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/IMG_7304.JPG" style="width: 1600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>I suppose the colour over here is the main part of the photo. Clarity and
contrast are also impressive. The flower itself looks exotic enough, though I
have no idea what it is. Flowers are probably the best subjects in
photography. They are quite beautiful, move very little and you can try a
hundred different exposures to get the right shot.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/IMG_7327.JPG" style="width: 1600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>While I'll be mean to call this an ugly butterfly (I'm sure it's not a moth!),
I think it looks magnificent over here. Although eye-pleasing colours are
practically non-existent in this photo, you should look at the contrast of the
ground to the insect. It looks pretty good, and the other insects around the
butterfly provide a level of detail, without which, this photo would look much
plainer.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/IMG_7331.JPG"/></p>
<p>Probably one of the best shots I took on that day. The coconut as a subject
may make you raise eyebrows, but it's totally unlike anything else I've shot.
The focusing was perfect here, giving the photo a very small depth of field.
Less can be more and this shot exemplifies it.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/IMG_7583.JPG" style="width: 1600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>You might've seen that I've only done close-up shots. This is one of the very
few landscape shots I've taken. Excellent scenery and I really don't have much
more to say about this.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/IMG_7843.JPG" style="width: 1600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>The mynah had a nice stance and perching position for this. The background is
suitably blurred over here and the foreground falls into focus nicely. The
background is great for this and the bird's details are captured with some
success.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/IMG_8064.JPG" style="width: 1600px; height: auto; max-width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>It might look odd to photograph only the head of a peacock without its
resplendent body. But the head itself actually has fantastic detail. The blue
colour stands out superbly and there is a generous amount of empty space in
the photo which is essential for greater emphasis on the bird. An unorthodox,
but great shot.  </p>
<p>That's it folks! (I have no idea why I quoted that)  </p>
<p>Comment, criticize, and praise at your own will.</p>
