            <p>Last month, I attended Akademy 2017, KDE's annual conference. This time it was held in Almeria, a small Andalusian city on the south-east coast of Spain.</p>
<p>My head is still spinning from the trip.</p>
<p>Akademy 2017 was a collection amazing, life-changing experiences. It was my first solo trip abroad and it taught me so much about travel, KDE, and getting around a city with only a handful of broken phrases in the local language. It was a rush to see faceless names on KDE mailing lists and IRC channels in the flesh.</p>
<h2>Travel</h2>
<p>My trip began from the recently renamed Kempegowda International Airport, Bangalore. Though the airport is small for an international airport, the small size of the airport makes it very easy to get around. Check-in and immigration was a breeze and I had a couple of hours to check out the loyalty card lounge, where I sipped soda water thinking about what the next seven days had in store.</p>
<p>The first leg of my trip was on a Etihad A320 to Abu Dhabi, a four hour flight departing at 2210 on 20 July. The A320 isn't particularly unique equipment, but then again, it was a rather short leg. The crew onboard that flight seemed to be a mix of Asian and European staff.</p>
<p>Economy class in Etihad was <em>much</em> better than any other Economy class product I've seen before. Ample legroom, very clean and comfortable seats, and an excellent IFE system. I was content looking at the HUD-style map visualisation which showed the AoA, vertical speed, and airspeed of the airplane.</p>
<p>On the way, I scribbled a quick diary entry and started reading part 1 of Sanderson's Stormlight Archive - 'The Way of Kings'.</p>
<p>Descent to Abu Dhabi airport started about 3:30 into the flight. Amber city lights illuminated the desert night sky. Even though it was past midnight, the plane's IFE reported an outside temperature of 35C. Disembarking from the plane, the muggy atmosphere hit me after spending four hours in an air-conditioned composite tube.</p>
<p>The airport was dominated by Etihad aircraft - mainly Airbus A330s, Boeing 787-8s, and Boeing 777-300ERs. There were also a number of other airlines part of the Etihad Airways Partners such as Alitalia, Jet Airways, and some Air Berlin equipment. Without wasting any time, I traversed a long terminal to reach the boarding gate for the connecting flight to Madrid.</p>
<p>The flight to Madrid was another Etihad operated flight, only this time, on the A320's larger brethren - the A330-200. This plane was markedly older than the A320 on the first leg of the trip. Fortunately, I got the port side window seat in a 2-5-2 configuration. The plane had a long take-off roll and took off a few minutes after 2am. Once we reached cruising altitude, I opened the window shade. The sky was remarkably clear and full of stars and I must have spent at least five minutes with my face glued to the window.</p>
<p>I tried to sleep, preparing myself for the long day ahead. Soon after waking up, the plane landed at Madrid Barajas Airport and taxied for nearly <em>half-an-hour</em> to reach the terminal. After clearing immigration, I picked up my suitcase and waited for a bus which would take me to my next stop - the Madrid Atocha Railway Station. Located in the heart of city, the Atocha station is one of Madrid's largest train stations and connects it to the rest of Spain. My train to Almeria was later that day - at 3:15 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>On reaching Atocha, I got my first good look at Madrid. It was a beautiful day, bright and sunny with the warmth balanced out by a light breeze. I was struck by how orderly everything was, starting with the traffic. Cars gave the right of way to pedestrians. People walked on zebra crossings and cyclists stuck to the defined cycling lanes. It may be a trivial detail, but it was a world apart from Bangalore. The cultural history which Madrid is known for showed right through the Baroque and Gothic architecture.</p>
<p>Having a few hours to kill before I had to catch my train, I roamed around Buen Retiro Park, one of Spain's largest public parks. Struggling with a heavy suitcase, my mobility was limited, so I tried to take in as much as I could sitting down every few minutes. The Park is a popular stomping ground for joggers, skaters, and cyclists alike. Despite it being 11am on a weekday, I saw plenty of people jogging though the park. After this, I trudged through some quaint cobbled neighborhoods with narrow roads and old apartment buildings. </p>
<p>Maybe it was the sleep-deprivation or dehydration after a long flight, but everything felt so surreal! I had to remind myself that I had come thousands of miles from home and was actually travelling on my own.</p>
