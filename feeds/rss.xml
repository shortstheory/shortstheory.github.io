the very name of this blog itself. Yes, we reached the population landmark of
7,000,000,000 or seven billion according to a UN estimate. According to me
population growth is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a good trend …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Arnav Dhamija</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2011 19:36:00 +0530</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:arnavdhamija.com,2011-10-31:/blog/7-billion.html</guid><category>Rants</category></item><item><title>Photography: Volume 1</title><link>http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/photography.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Hi guys, its been a long time since I've updated this. Got a few photos with
my awesome Canon SX1-IS cam. (click to enlarge)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_5067.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pity, because I always found that a rather attractive flower. But a great
photo opportunity as well!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why thee vile insect, must consume min winsome …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Arnav Dhamija</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2011 19:40:00 +0530</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:arnavdhamija.com,2011-10-19:/blog/photography.html</guid><category>Photography</category></item><item><title>'The 1 = Everything' equation</title><link>http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/1-everything-equation.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;What's your unlucky number?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"13", say some people  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nooo, 4", say the others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My unlucky number's 1. Yup.  The closest whole number to zero really sucks for
me. Cricket: Lost by 1 run. Badminton: 20-21 (no deuces). It's pretty much
everywhere. More so from a competitive exam viewpoint: NSO, IMO …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Arnav Dhamija</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2011 13:57:00 +0530</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:arnavdhamija.com,2011-09-21:/blog/1-everything-equation.html</guid><category>Rants</category></item><item><title>After the exams...</title><link>http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/after-exams.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Well, today concluded a week's long affair of exertion. To be honest, it
really wasn't a lot of work this time. Can't say that these exams really ended
on a high note with every student's perennial fear - Hindi.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photography's awesome! Expect pictures in my upcoming posts.  &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Arnav Dhamija</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2011 19:39:00 +0530</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:arnavdhamija.com,2011-09-20:/blog/after-exams.html</guid><category>Misc</category></item><item><title>Before the exams...</title><link>http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/before-exams.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I really haven't been doing justice to this blog for quite some time. It's
probably out of laziness that I couldn't bring myself to update it either.
With the advent of Pokemon Platinum on the emulator, factor the time I want to
spend on this to zero.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That can change …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Arnav Dhamija</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2011 20:45:00 +0530</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:arnavdhamija.com,2011-09-09:/blog/before-exams.html</guid><category>Misc</category></item><item><title>My First Post on My First Blog</title><link>http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/my-first-blog.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Blogging. Well, something I've wanted to do earnestly for some time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just as well, this is and will be my very first post.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(May 8. The day of the 2011 National NTSE round. MAT lifted my hopes but SAT
equally crushed them. Time will tell the efforts.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Arnav Dhamija</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2011 10:58:00 +0530</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:arnavdhamija.com,2011-05-09:/blog/my-first-blog.html</guid><category>FirstPost</category><category>Misc</category></item></channel></rss>
