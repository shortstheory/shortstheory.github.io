It's been an interesting experience to wane myself off of social media on my phone and that experience certainly deserves a post of its own soon. Until then, here are some of my thoughts on the books I finished reading this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Checklist Manifesto - Atul Gawande&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title gives away the premise of the book - which is about the art of managing and creating efficient checklists. This may not exactly sound like a jaw clenching thriller of a book, but Atul Gawande manages to keep the pages turning with interesting anecdotes about checklists. A surgeon by profession, Gawande lists instances about how his carefully curated surgery checklist saved lives in the operating theater. As an aviation geek, I enjoyed the story of how creating a pre-flight checklist for the Boeing 299 saved Boeing from the brink of bankruptcy in a fiercely competitive aviation market. There are narratives about the flip side too. For example, verbose checklists with too many steps for the user to follow may do more harm than having no checklist at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the book reads as a collection of anecdotes of varying quality. Pointers on creating a good checklist is scattered too thin throughout the book to be useful. That said, my opinion of this book is probably not the best thing to go by as I finished the book over a period of months which broke the continuity of a book which wasn't very continuous to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything - Levitt and Dubner&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen this book practically everywhere. I've heard praises sung about it at length from friends. I've even been listening to the Freakonomics radio &lt;em&gt;podcast&lt;/em&gt; for quite a while. But it was only last month I picked up this book. The cover makes bold claims such as &lt;em&gt;"...Explores The Hidden Side of Everything"&lt;/em&gt; along with some terms of endearment from Malcolm Gladwell. Coming to the content, the book covers a range of bizarre topics such as 'What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common?' and 'Why Do Drug Dealers Still Live with Their Moms?'. Which is great, because the book does make convincing conclusions on these two topics. However, this cannot be said for some of the other chapters such as 'What Makes a Perfect Parent?' and how a child's name is detrimental to their future prospects. I feel the book doesn't spend enough time establishing how a certain cause leads to an effect in these chapters. The authors do include a pretty long list of citations for each fact at the end of the book (nearly as long as the content itself!), so their claims might be substantiated after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Russian Roulette - Anthony Horowitz&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me forever to find this book. I used to be an avid fan of Alex Rider in school, but I lost track of the series in my dry spell of reading in 11th and 12th. Russian Roulette is something of a spin-off book, set somewhere in the middle of Stormbreaker in the Alex Rider timeline. The book narrates the story of Yassen, a key character throughout the Alex Rider series. Like most Anthony Horowitz books, it's not a particularly well-written book. Rather, it keeps one engaged with a fast (but somewhat predictable) plot. I liked some of the parts from Yassen's past in Russia, though the rest read like a rehash of Scorpia. Still, I finished this book much faster than I usually take to finish a book of its length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Bird by Bird - Anne Lamott&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, Anne Lammot speaks about the joys and frustrations in the solitary world of a writer. From the outset, I loved this book. Lammot's writing style is hilarious and is loaded with dry wit and sarcasm. As with 'The Checklist Manifesto', the book follows off on tangents with no central plot to speak of. On my first read of 'Bird by Bird', I couldn't help feeling that this book would read better as a blog than a novel.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Reading"></category></entry><entry><title>Blog Migration Complete!</title><link href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/blog-migration.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2017-02-05T23:50:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Arnav Dhamija</name></author><id>tag:arnavdhamija.com,2017-02-05:blog/blog-migration.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now I finally have my very own domain name! The &lt;a href="http://arnavdhamija.blogspot.in/"&gt;old Blogger site&lt;/a&gt; is still available if anyone wants to see it but for all future intents and purposes, this will be the place where new blog posts will be put up. While I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; configure all traffic to the Blogger site to redirect to this one, the old site has grown on me so much over the years that I feel that it would be a shame to hide it that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to migrate from Blogger because it is more than evident that Blogger has been getting less love from Google than it deserves. Take for instance, the Blogger web-based post editor - a shining example of an undeveloped relic of Google's products. Posts never autosaved or had any manual version control and a few misplaced keypresses could cause you to lose all your writing progress. Inserting images is a chore and putting up more complicated parts of text such as code blocks and sub-headings is even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course as with most things in software development, there are workarounds for everything. The work-around which I had used for the last few blog posts was to write directly in Markdown and then convert it to HTML with pandoc to copy paste in the Blogger editor. Even so, this is clearly sub-optimal and I was spending more time wrestling with the Blogger editor to make my pages look good than I was spending writing actual content. The Blogger theme which I was using appealled to me as 13 year old (heck, it still appeals to me), but it was growing long in the tooth and only had basic support for responsive design and mobile devices. With all these things in mind, I started looking for a new home for my blog somewhere in the middle of last December on a break from college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first looked at &lt;a href="http://wordpress.com/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;. At first, it seemed like my search for a new blogging platform would stop here. Open-sourced, a great browser editor, a cohesive Android app, direct editing in Markdown, local installation for testing, and support for plugins made WordPress everything Blogger wasn't. I loved the number of themes and customisation WordPress provided. But the love was short lived, and it ended when I started researching hosting options for WordPress. Most solutions required me to rent a web-server on a monthly basis and I had no idea what tier of server to get as my blog had only recently seen a huge surge in pageviews. Not to mention, the cost of maintaining a website with such a setup was by no means cheap. This is when I started asking to my geeky friends about how they maintained their own personal websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks were very helpful, it made me realise that a dynamic blogging solution such as WordPress was overkill for a humble blog of less than 30 published posts like this one. Having a static site made so much more sense. I could write directly in Markdown, in the text editor of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; choice. Not to mention, it made the workflow of writing a blog post just like I wrote code, &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;git push&lt;/code&gt; straight to GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages, by the way, offers completely &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; hosting for static sites. This means that the only thing I would need to pay for would be the custom domain name, a nominal ₹700 ($10) a year, an amount half of what I would be paying for a month of paid hosting. Plus, it would let me get my hands dirty with a bit of web development, something which I had pushed back for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to start this - what I knew was going to be painful task at about 11pm on a night I just knew I wouldn't be able to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step was to convert all my Blogger posts to Markdown. There were some tools online but all of them messed up the conversion pretty badly. After some more digging, I ended up using Aaron Swartz's &lt;a href="https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text"&gt;html2text&lt;/a&gt; Python library which did a better job than other solutions in generating some useful Markdown. I still needed to edit every generated Markdown file by hand to make it something I would be happy with using on my site. I then had to export all the images I had on my Blogger site. This lead to a few more laborious hours of saving each image on the site by hand (Right Click -&amp;gt; View as Image -&amp;gt; Save As). It did cross my mind to automate everything with a script, but it was going to take more time to automate everything and check if the automation was working than it was to do the grunt work of pulling the images. With all the resources safely on my laptop and backed on my Dropbox, I took the next step of looking at static site generators to convert my lovingly handmade Markdown files to HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Pages seemed to heavily advocate &lt;a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; so I went with it first. With some tinkering to get the Ruby dependencies installed and posts adapted for Jekyll with the Front Matter content, I managed to get a pretty presentable blog running on localhost:4000/ at 5am on that day. With a quick push to my &lt;a href="http://shortstheory.github.com/"&gt;github.io&lt;/a&gt; site, I decided to call it a night and slept off a sleep-deprived session of hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few days I played with some more Jekyll themes and found that there were many things I didn't like about it. For one thing, it was written in Ruby which I have no experience with. Themes didn't look easy to work with and there was no native support for tags (there is a workaround for this, but due to my lack of Ruby-fu, it all looked terribly arcane to me). I then put the blog migration on the back burner for a while to work on projects at my college's Automation &amp;amp; Robotics Club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later I decided to look at the blog with the fresh perspective which comes with taking a break. Again, I poked around to look for alternatives to Jekyll. There was one such alternative which ticked all my boxes - a static site generator called &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;. As WordPress looked inherently superior to Blogger, Pelican looked inherently superior to Jekyll for what I wanted to do with it. For example, it had built-in support for tags, had a theming engine, supported Markdown &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; reStructuredText, and had several easy to install plugins. Above all, Pelican is written in Python which made it so much easier for me to mess around with it. There were some more modifications to make to the Markdown files (particularly with the post metadata), but it was so trivial that it didn't pain one bit to modify all the files. Not too long after I settled on Pelican, I found a theme which made my blog look exactly how I wanted it to look. The &lt;a href="https://github.com/PurePelicanTheme"&gt;Pure Single&lt;/a&gt; theme also has nifty support for custom sidebar images, which I used on some select &lt;a href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/t2-years-and-counting-iit-jee.html"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/gsoc-report-wrapping-up-gsoc-2016.html"&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some initial trouble with setting a blog subfolder in the site and getting images to work on some auto-generated sites (such as the Tags and Categories pages). It later turned out that it was some problem with localhost/ not finding the paths correctly to the images and the site was totally fine when published to the GitHub Pages site. After only three days of using Pelican, I had something which I was willing to show off. The next step was much more straightforward for a change - registering a domain name. I looked into a few options such as GoDaddy and Hover, but Namecheap had a lot more positive reviews than GoDaddy and was the cheapest of the lot. The site configuration to serve pages from GitHub's servers was not more than a 10 minute procedure, and I finally had the site you are reading this article on right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a lot more changes coming up on this blog, some of them aesthetic and some functional. I'm also probably going to change the name of this blog sometime soon, to something which is more reflective of my current tastes and sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Misc"></category><category term="Programming"></category></entry><entry><title>What I've been upto</title><link href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/this-semester-has-gone-little-too-fast.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-12-19T11:09:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Arnav Dhamija</name></author><id>tag:arnavdhamija.com,2016-12-19:blog/this-semester-has-gone-little-too-fast.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This semester has gone a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; too fast for my liking. Though there were
plenty of good memories and takeaways from this semester, it has been by far
my most stressful time in this college yet. Between taking on a number of
technical projects and trying to rescue a sharply falling SG due to a poor T1,
there has been very little free time this sem. Above all, this sem has shown
me just how limited of a resource brain power is. Thinking about solving
problems wears me out much more easily than it used to.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not to say what I've been doing is all drudgery. Some interesting
projects that I've been working on:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;GSoC 2016 Project - kio-stash&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup, this &lt;a href="https://github.com/KDE/kio-stash"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; has been in the pipeline
for months. While it (mostly) works on a clean install of KDE, it has some
bugs with copying with mtp:/ device slaves and isn't very well integrated with
Dolphin yet. It is in my best interest to have this shipped with KDE
Frameworks as soon as possible, so I'm looking into patching Dolphin with
better, more specific action support for my project.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;IEEE Signal Processing Cup 2017 - Real-Time Beat Tracking Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise of this project doesn't seem very complicated - a team just needs
to submit an algorithm which can successfully detect the beats in a song in
real-time on an embedded device. Heck, I had already implemented the same on
an Arduino with a microphone for rather &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMb1XScNgOs"&gt;fancy lighting in my hostel
room&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, as I've
learned the hard way, anything that looks simple is deceptive and this project
is a perfect example. For one thing, a song by itself in the amplitude-time
domain is nearly impossible to extract any data from, so it requires a (Fast)
Fourier Transform to extract frequency bin amplitudes to get anything useful
from it. Next, obtaining beat onset and detection requires generating a
tempogram to find the BPM of a song to find the approximate beat positions.
There are many interesting approaches and different algorithms to solve this
problem. Fortunately, I'm not doing this alone and the seniors I'm working
with have a better understanding of the more difficult mathematical components
of this project, leaving me free to code in C++ and deploy it on actual
hardware.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;foss@bphc&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is a society on campus I started with
&lt;a href="https://github.com/aero31aero/"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/TestSubjector"&gt;programmers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://github.com/Nischay-
Pro/"&gt;far&lt;/a&gt; more competent than myself. It all started in September this year
when we had the two-day long &lt;a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Hackathon_BPHC"&gt;Wikimedia
Hackathon&lt;/a&gt; on campus.
Though my contribution to Wikimedia was small, I got a lot out of the
hackathon by meeting the people from Amrita University who came for organising
the event. Listening to what
&lt;a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:01tonythomas"&gt;Tony&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://srijanagarwal.me/"&gt;Srijan&lt;/a&gt; had to say about how much working for
foss@amrita had benefited them made me realise how much room for improvement
there was in BPHC. As far as this society goes, things are still in their
infancy, yet I feel there is just enough critical mass of talent and
enthusiasm in open source development to push this society forward. We even
have our own
&lt;a href="https://fossbphc.github.io/docs/constitution.html"&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Making a personal website?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Blogspot has been a faithful home for this blog for over half a decade,
it is time to move to a modern solution for hosting. Plus setting up a website
will teach me a bit about web development too, and I've needed an excuse to
learn it for a while. Surely it can't be all that hard, right?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Burnout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the slew of all these technical projects seemed like a good idea at the
time, it has pushed me closer to burning out. It is the same feeling as what I
felt the same time last year, albeit for different reasons.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of it has carried over from studying harder at the end of this sem than I
had done so before. To my surprise, studying under pressure was actually more
effective than it was without. In some ways, it was a throwback to studying
for the number of exams nearly a couple of years ago. It has made me question
whether any of my education was as much for the knowledge as it was for the
desperation of avoiding failure. I still haven't figured it out, but at least
I feel like I'm not as adverse to putting in the hours for getting a decent
CGPA as I had been last semester.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been compromises in other spheres of college life as well,
investing so much time in studying or doing projects has made me cut down my
participation in other clubs and I've quit nearly all the non-technical clubs
I joined last year. There's more than that too - I feel it's much harder to be
fully immersed in anything anymore.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's just something else which requires more soul searching.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="College"></category><category term="Life"></category><category term="KDE"></category></entry><entry><title>GSoC Report - Wrapping up GSoC 2016</title><link href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/gsoc-report-wrapping-up-gsoc-2016.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-08-30T01:45:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Arnav Dhamija</name></author><id>tag:arnavdhamija.com,2016-08-30:blog/gsoc-report-wrapping-up-gsoc-2016.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;That’s it. After a &lt;a href="https://github.com/KDE/kio-
stash/graphs/contributors"&gt;combined total&lt;/a&gt; of 217 git commits, 6,202 lines of code added, and
4,167 lines of code deleted, GSoC 2016 is finally over.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/Screenshot_20160830_014801.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These twelve weeks of programming have been a very enriching experience for me
and making this project has taught me a lot about production quality software
development. Little did I know that a &lt;a href="https://github.com/shortstheory/filetray-very-early-alpha-idea-
thingy"&gt;small
project&lt;/a&gt; I had put together in a 6 hour session of messing around with Qt would
lead to something as big as this!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been many memorable moments throughout my coding period for the
GSoC - such as the first time I got an ioslave to
&lt;a href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/gsoc-update-1-beginning.html"&gt;install&lt;/a&gt; correctly, to writing its “Hello World”
&lt;a href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/gsoc-update-writing-kio-slave-101.html"&gt;equivalent&lt;/a&gt;, and getting a basic implementation of the project up and
running by doing a series of dirty hacks with Dolphin’s code. There were also
times when I was so frustrated with debugging for this project, that I wanted
to do nothing but smash my laptop’s progressively failing display panel with
the largest hammer I could find. The great mentorship from my GSoC mentor and
the premise of the GSoC program itself kept me going. This also taught me an
important lesson with regards to software development - no one starting out
gets it right on their first try. It feels like after a long run of not quite
getting the results I wanted, the GSoC is the thing which worked out for me as
everything just fell into place.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a technical digression here, which you can feel free to skip through
if you don’t want to get into the details of the project.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following up from the &lt;a href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/gsoc-update-tinkering-with-kio.html"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; blog post, with the core features of the
application complete, I had moved on to unit testing my project. For this
project, unit testing involved writing test cases for each and every component
of the application to find and fix any bugs. Despite the innocuous name, unit
testing this project was a much bigger challenge than I expected. As for one
thing, the ioslave in my project is merely a controller in the MVC system of
the virtual Stash File System, the Dolphin file manager, and the KIO Slave
itself. Besides, most of the ioslave’s functions have a void return type, so
feeding the slave’s functions’ arguments to get an output for checking was not
an option either.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led me to use an approach, which my mentor aptly called “black box
testing”.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this approach, one writes unit tests testing for a specific action and then
checking for whether the effects of the said action are as expected. In this
case, the ioslave was tested by giving it a test file and then apply some of
the ioslave’s functions such as copy, rename, delete, and stat. From there,
through a bunch of QVERIFY calls is to check whether the ioslave has completed
the operation successfully. Needless to say, this approach is far more
convoluted to write unit tests for as it required checking each and every test
file for its properties in every test case. Fortunately, the
&lt;a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qtestlib-manual.html#qtestlib"&gt;QTestLib&lt;/a&gt; API is
pretty well documented so it wasn’t difficult to get started with writing unit
tests. I also had a template of what a good test suite should look like thanks
to David Faure’s excellent work on implementing automated unit testing for the
Trash ioslave. With these two tools in hand, I started off with writing unit
tests shortly before the second year of college started.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, writing black box unit tests was a PITA in its own right. The
first time I ran my unit test I came up with a dismal score of 6 unit tests
passed out of the 17 I had written. This lead me to go back and check whether
my unit tests were testing correctly at all. It turned out that I had made so
many mistakes with writing the unit tests that an entire rewrite of the test
suite wasn’t unwarranted.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a rewrite of the test cases completed, I ran the test suite again. The
results were a bit better - 13 out of the 17 test cases passed, but 4 failed
test cases - enough reason for the project to be unshippable. Looking into the
issue a bit deeper, I found out that all the D-Bus calls to my ioslave for
copy and move operations were not working correctly! Given that I had spent so
much time on making sure the ioslave was robust enough, this was a mixed
surprise. Finally, after a week of rewriting and to an extent, refactoring the
rename and copy functions of the ioslave, I got the best terminal output I
ever wanted from this project.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/Screenshot_20160829_184812.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely the highest point of the GSoC for me. From there on out, it was a
matter of putting the code on the slow burner for cleaning up any leftover
debug statements and for writing documentation for other obscure sections.
With a net total of nearly 2000 lines of code, it far surpasses any other
project I’ve done in terms of size and quality of code written.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some points in the project, I felt that the stipend was far too generous,
for many people working on KDE &lt;em&gt;voluntarily&lt;/em&gt; produce projects much larger
thann mine. In the end, I feel the best way to repay the generosity is to
continue with open source development - just as the GSoC intended. Prior to
the GSoC, open source was simply an interesting concept to me, but
contributing a couple of thousands of lines of code to an open source codebase
has made me realise just how powerful open source is. There were no
restrictions on when I had to work (usually my productivity was at its peak at
outlandish late night hours), on the machine I used for coding (a trusty
IdeaPad, replaced with a much nicer ThinkPad), or on the place where I felt
most comfortable coding from (a toss up between my much used study table or
the living room). In many ways, working from home was probably the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt;
environment I could ask for when it came to working on this project. Hacking
on an open source project gave me a sense of gratification solving a problem
in competitive programming never could have.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Google Summer of Code may be over, but my journey with open source
development has just begun. Here’s to even bigger and better projects in the
future!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="GSoC"></category><category term="KDE"></category></entry><entry><title>GSoC Update: Tinkering with KIO</title><link href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/gsoc-update-tinkering-with-kio.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-07-21T15:18:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Arnav Dhamija</name></author><id>tag:arnavdhamija.com,2016-07-21:blog/gsoc-update-tinkering-with-kio.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm a lot closer to finishing the project now. Thanks to some great support
from my GSoC mentor, my project has turned out better than what I had written
about in my proposal! Working together, we've made a lot of changes to the
project.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, we've changed the name of the ioslave from "File Tray" to
"staging" to "stash". I wasn't a big fan of the name change, but I see the
utility in shaving off a couple of characters in the name of what I hope will
be a widely used feature.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the ioslave is now completely independent from Dolphin, or any KIO
application for that matter. This means it works &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same way across
the entire suite of KIO apps. Given that at one point we were planning to make
the ioslave fully functional only with Dolphin, this is a major plus point for
the project.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the backend for storing stashed files and folders has undergone a
complete overhaul. The first iteration of the project stored files and folders
by saving the URLs of stashed items in a QList in a custom "stash" daemon
running on top of kded5. Although this was a neat little solution which worked
well for most intents and purposes, it had some disadvantages. For one, you
couldn't delete and move files around on the ioslave without affecting the
source because they were all linked to their original directories. Moreover,
with the way 'mkdir' works in KIO, this solution would never work without each
application being specially configured to use the ioslave which would entail a
lot of groundwork laying out QDBus calls to the stash daemon. With these
problems looming large, somewhere around the midterm evaluation week, I got a
message from my mentor about ramping up the project using a "StashFileSystem",
a virtual file system in Qt that he had written just for this project.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virtual file system is a clever way to approach this - as it solved both
of the problems with the previous approach right off the bat - mkdir could be
mapped to virtual directory and now making volatile edits to folders is
possible without touching the source directory. It did have its drawbacks too - as it needed to stage every file in the source directory, it would require a
lot more memory than the previous approach. Plus, it would still be at the
whims of kded5 if a contained process went bad and crashed the daemon.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the benefits in this case far outweighed the potential cons and
I got to implementing it in my ioslave and stash daemon. Using this virtual
file system also meant remapping all the SlaveBase functions to corresponding
calls to the stash daemon which was a complete rewrite of my code. For
instance, my GitHub log for the week of implementing the virtual file system
showed a sombre 449++/419--. This isn't to say it wasn't productive though -
to my surprise the virtual file system actually worked better than I hoped it
would! Memory utilisation is low at a nominal ~300 bytes per stashed file and
the performance in my manual testing has been looking pretty good.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the ioslave and other modules of the application largely completed, the
current phase of the project involves integrating the feature neatly with
Dolphin and for writing a couple of unit tests along the way. I'm looking
forward to a good finish with this project.  &lt;/p&gt;

has been going well. Though it was expectedly difficult in the beginning, I
feel like I am on the other side of the learning curve now. I will probably
make a proper update post sometime later this month. My repo for this project
can be found here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/shortstheory/staging-kioslave"&gt;https://github.com/shortstheory/staging-kioslave&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, this is a small tutorial for writing KDE I/O slaves (KIO slaves)
which can be used for a variety of KDE applications. KIO slaves are a great
way for accessing files from different filesystems and protocols in a neat,
uniform way across many KDE applications. Their versatility makes them
integral to the KIO library. KIO slaves have changed in their structure the
transition to KF5 and this tutorial highlights some of these differences from
preceding iterations of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Project Structure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of this tutorial, your project source directory needs to have
the following files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kio_hello.h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kio_hello.cpp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hello.json&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CMakeLists.txt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't feel like creating these yourself, just clone it from here:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/shortstheory/kioslave-tutorial"&gt;https://github.com/shortstheory/kioslave-tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;hello.json&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The .json file replaces the .protocol files used in KIO slaves pre KF5. The
.json file for the KIO slave specifies the properties the KIO slave will have
such as the executable path to the KIO slave on installation. The .json file
also includes properties of the slave such as being able to read from, write
to, delete from, among many others. Fields in this .json file are specified
from the &lt;a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKProt
ocolManager.html"&gt;KProtocolManager&lt;/a&gt; class. For creating a KIO slave capable of showing a
directory in a file manager such as Dolphin, the listing property must be set
to true. As an example, the .json file for the Hello KIO slave described in
this tutorial looks like this:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;{  
    &amp;quot;KDE-KIO-Protocols&amp;quot; : {   
        &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;: {   
            &amp;quot;Class&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;:local&amp;quot;,   
            &amp;quot;X-DocPath&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;kioslave5/kio_hello.html&amp;quot;,   
            &amp;quot;exec&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;kf5/kio/hello&amp;quot;,   
            &amp;quot;input&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;,   
            &amp;quot;output&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;filesystem&amp;quot;,   
            &amp;quot;protocol&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;,   
            &amp;quot;reading&amp;quot;: true   
        }   
    }   
}  
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As for the CMakeLists.txt, you will need to link your KIO slave module with
KF5::KIOCore. This can be seen in the project directory.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;kio_hello.h&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#ifndef HELLO_H  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#define HELLO_H  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;kio/slavebase.h&amp;gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="cm"&gt;/**  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cm"&gt;  This class implements a Hello World kioslave  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cm"&gt; */&lt;/span&gt;   
&lt;span class="n"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;QObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;KIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SlaveBase&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Q_OBJECT&lt;/span&gt;   
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;QByteArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;QByteArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;   
    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;QUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Q_DECL_OVERRIDE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;   
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#endif  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Hello KIO slave is derived from KIO::SlaveBase. The SlaveBase class has
some basic functions already implemented for the KIO slave. This can be found
in the &lt;a href="https://api.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1Sla
veBase.html"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;. However, most of the functions of SlaveBase are virtual
functions and have to be re-implemented for the KIO slave. In this case, we
are re-implementing the get function to print a QString when it is called by
kioclient5.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you don't need special handling of the KIO slave's functions, you can
derive your KIO slave class directly from &lt;a href="https://a
pi.kde.org/frameworks/kio/html/classKIO_1_1ForwardingSlaveBase.html"&gt;KIO::ForwardingSlaveBase&lt;/a&gt;. Here,
you would only need to re-implement the rewriteUrl function to get your KIO
slave working.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;kio_hello.cpp&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;quot;hello.h&amp;quot;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;QDebug&amp;gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nl"&gt;KIOPluginForMetaData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;QObject&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Q_OBJECT&lt;/span&gt;   
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Q_PLUGIN_METADATA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;IID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;org.kde.kio.slave.hello&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;hello.json&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;   
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class="k"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;C&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Q_DECL_EXPORT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;kdemain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;argc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;   
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;   
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;qDebug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Launching KIO slave.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;   
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;   
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;fprintf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stderr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Usage: kio_hello protocol domain-socket1 domain-socket2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;   
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;exit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;   
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;   
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;slave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;argv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;   
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;slave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dispatchLoop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;   
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;   
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;   
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;QUrl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;qDebug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Entering function.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;   
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;mimeType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;text/plain&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;   
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;QByteArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Hello world!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;   
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;   
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;finished&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;   
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;qDebug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Leaving function&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;   
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;QByteArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;QByteArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SlaveBase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;   

&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;quot;hello.moc&amp;quot;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The .moc file is, of course, auto-generated at compilation time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, the KIO Slave's .cpp file will also require a new
KIOPluginForMetaData class to add the .json file. The following is used for
the hello KIO slave and can be used as an example:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;KIOPluginForMetaData&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span class="n"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;QObject&lt;/span&gt;  
{  
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;Q_OBJECT   &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;    Q_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PLUGIN_METADATA&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="n"&gt;IID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;org.kde.kio.slave.hello&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;FILE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;hello.json&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;)   
};  
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;CMakeLists.txt&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cmake_minimum_required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;VERSION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;3.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;QT_MIN_VERSION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;5.4.0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;KF5_MIN_VERSION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;5.16.0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;find_package&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;ECM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;KF5_MIN_VERSION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;REQUIRED&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;NO_MODULE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="s"&gt;CMAKE_MODULE_PATH&lt;/span&gt;   
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CMAKE_MODULE_PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;   
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ECM_MODULE_PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;   
        &lt;span class="o"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;ECM_KDE_MODULE_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;   
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;KDEInstallDirs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;KDECMakeSettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;KDECompilerSettings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;NO_POLICY_SCOPE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;ECMSetupVersion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;FeatureSummary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;target_link_libraries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;kio_hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;KF5::KIOCore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;set_target_properties&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;kio_hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;PROPERTIES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;OUTPUT_NAME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;TARGETS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;kio_hello&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;DESTINATION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;KDE_INSTALL_PLUGINDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/kf5/kio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply run the following commands in the source folder:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;mkdir build  
cd build  
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DKDE_INSTALL_USE_QT_SYS_PATHS=TRUE ..  
make  
sudo make install  
kdeinit5  
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As shown above, we have to run kdeinit5 again so the new KIO slave is
discovered by KLauncher and can be loaded when we run a command through an
application such as kioclient5.&lt;br /&gt;
Testing  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;kioclient5 &amp;#39;cat&amp;#39; &amp;#39;hello:/&amp;#39;  
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And the output should be:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Hello_world

project&lt;/a&gt; under
the mentorship of &lt;a href="https://blog.baloneygeek.com/"&gt;Boudhayan Gupta &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="http://blog.pinak.me/"&gt;Pinak
Ahuja&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project idea's implementation has undergone some changes from what I
proposed. While the essence of the project is the same, it will now no longer
be dependent on Baloo and xattr. Instead, it will use a QList to hold a list
of staged files with a plugin to kiod. My next milestone before the mid-term
evaluation is to implement this in a KIO slave which will be compatible with
the whole suite of KDE applications.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last two weeks, I've been busy with going through hundreds of lines of
source code to understand the concept of a KIO slave. The KIO API is a very
neat feature of KDE - it provides a single, consistent way to access remote
and local filesystems. This is further expanded to KIO slaves which are
programs based on the KIO API which allow for a filesystem to be expressed in
a particular way. For instance, there is a KIO slave for displaying xattr file
&lt;a href="http://vhanda.in/blog/2014/07/tagging-your-files/"&gt;tags&lt;/a&gt; as a directory under
which each file marked to a tag would be displayed. KIO slaves even expand to
network protocols allowing for remote access using slaves such as http:/,
ftp:/, smb:/ (for Windows samba shares), fish:/, sftp:/, nfs:/, and webdav:/.
My project requires virtual folder constructed of URLs stored in a QList - an
ideal fit for KIO slaves.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, hacking on KIO slaves was not exactly straightforward. Prior to my
GSoC selection, I had no idea on how to edit CMakeLists.txt files and it was a
task to learn to make one by hand. Initially, it felt like installing the
dependencies for building KIO slaves would almost certainly lead to me
destroying my KDE installation, and sure enough, I did manage to ruin my
installation. Most annoying. Fortunately, I managed to recover my data and
with a fresh install of Kubuntu 16.04 with all the required KDE packages, I
got back to working on getting the technical equivalent of a Hello World to
work with a KIO slave.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This too, was more than a matter of just copying and pasting lines of code
from the &lt;a href="https://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/KIO_Sla
ves/Hello_World"&gt;KDE tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. KIO slaves had dropped the use of .protocol files in the KF5
transition, instead opting for JSON files to store the properties of the KIO
slave. Thankfully, I had the assistance of the legendary &lt;a href="https://behindkde.org/david-faure-2"&gt;David
Faure&lt;/a&gt;. Under his guidance, I managed to
port the KIO slave in the tutorial to a KF5 compatible KIO slave and after a
full week of frustration of dealing with dependency hell, I saw the best Hello
World I could ever hope for:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/kioslave.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baby steps. The next step was to make the KIO slave capable of displaying the
contents of a specified QUrl in a file manager. The documentation for
KProtocolManager made it seem like a pretty straightforward task - apparently
that all I needed to do was to add a "listing" entry in my JSON protocol file
and I would have to re-implement the listDir method inherited from SlaveBase
using a call to SlaveBase::listDir(&amp;amp;QUrl). Unbeknownst to me, the SlaveBase
class actually didn't have any code for displaying a directory! The SlaveBase
class was only for reimplementing its member functions in a derived class as I
found out by going through the source code of the core of kio/core. Learning
from my mistake here I switched to using a ForwardingSlaveBase class for my
KIO slave which instantly solved my problems of displaying a directory.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/helloslave.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fistpump&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to my timeline, the next steps in the project are  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finishing off the KIO slave by the end of this month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making GUI modifications in Dolphin to accommodate the staging area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking of a better name for this feature?
So far, it's been a great experience to get so much support from the KDE
community. Here's to another two and a half months of KDE development!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been selected for the Google Summer of Code!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the better part of the summer vacation, I will now be committing myself to
write code for &lt;a href="https://www.kde.org/"&gt;KDE&lt;/a&gt; to implement my project idea of
implementing a &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/BYOWdG"&gt;virtual folder in Dolphin&lt;/a&gt; to make it
easier to select files.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a primer, the &lt;a href="http://g.co/gsoc"&gt;Google Summer of Code &lt;/a&gt;(GSoC) is an annual
event organized by Google for drawing students to work on open source projects
with a nice stipend, goodies, and fame. The GSoC is a term one would hear
pretty frequently when talking about the technical prowess and coding culture
of a college.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, BITS Pilani - Hyderabad Campus had a record number of a total of
&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt; selections! This is more than double of our previous record. This in
some ways, might be the start of the technical culture wave this campus was
looking for so long.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The File Tray idea for the GSoC came at a difficult time, hardly a month after
the entrance exams in 2015. It was at a time I was frustrated with everything
I had done and I didn't have any energy to pursue anything at all having been
completely drained out by the entrance exams prior to it. From there, the
project sat on the list of "Things I Might Do In The Distant Future". The
project idea was known only to a few close friends and my tiny programming
diary.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only till November 2015 when I stumbled across the GSoC. I began
looking at open source file managers for which I could implement my project
idea. I had been using Linux with various desktop environments for about 4
years at that point, so I had a pretty decent idea of what to look for.
Writing this feature for GNOME's Nautilus was the first thing I looked into as
I had been using Nautilus for a while and I was a big fan of Nautilus's simple
to use interface. But, the problem was that Nautilus was a C/GTK+ project and
I had no desire to move on to using C after having C++ in my comfort zone for
a very long time. Fortunately, Dolphin, one of the best file managers I had
used since my days of using KDE, used C++/Qt, a toolset I am much better with.
I felt my project idea was a natural fit for Dolphin's Split view mode. KDE
also had an excellent record in the GSoC with a very good number of slots and
a high percentage of successful projects. This began my tryst with Open Source
development.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there on, I taught myself &lt;a href="http://www.qt.io/"&gt;Qt&lt;/a&gt; and during a Diwali
vacation on campus, I managed to make a very rough &lt;a href="https://github.com/shortstheory/filetray-very-early-alpha-idea-
thingy"&gt;prototype
application&lt;/a&gt; of my project after coding for 6 hours straight from 11pm to 5am the
next day. Following this, I subscribed to KDE's mailing lists and after
lurking around for a while, I started asking for feedback on my GSoC idea.
With surprisingly positive feedback from numerous KDE developers, I realized
that there might just be a non-zero chance of getting selected.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things quickly began falling into place and I then moved on to the next step
of hunting around for bugs I could fix and new features I could implement for
Dolphin. The bug-fixing was as enjoyable as it was occasionally frustrating.
Reading over 20000 lines of code certainly took its toll when I had no idea
when how different parts of the application meshed together. In the end,
thanks to the guidance of Dolphin maintainer, Emmanuel Pescosta, I managed to
fix a couple of things for Dolphin and moved on to the next step of making a
proposal for my GSoC application.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting off with making a competent proposal was like launching off ground
zero as there were very few people who had successfully completed the GSoC
from our campus and most of these people had graduated well before this time.
I started digging around for proposals accepted by KDE in previous GSoC's.
What I couldn't get from all the proposals was some sound advice from seniors.
In particular, &lt;a href="https://github.com/naveenjafer"&gt;Naveen Jafer bhaiya&lt;/a&gt; (who also
went on to achieve a GSoC project of his own!) helped me with making my
proposal as good as possible. In the end, after painstakingly checking every
word in my proposal for what felt like the fiftieth time I submitted it on 25
March, only to spend an anxious month waiting for the results which came out
at 1230am IST on April 23. While it still hasn't sunk in yet (!), I am sure
that this will make for an awesome summer vacation!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="GSoC"></category><category term="KDE"></category></entry><entry><title>What do I do now?</title><link href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/what-do-i-do-now.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-04-14T01:38:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Arnav Dhamija</name></author><id>tag:arnavdhamija.com,2016-04-14:blog/what-do-i-do-now.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time thinking since I've joined college.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had postponed a lot of introspection during the two years I spent slogging
away for the JEE. But now, with ample free time and practically no requirement
to go to classes, I've finally got some time to look back and see how things
have turned out. College started off on the back foot, and while 1-1 had its
charms, I wasn't exactly happy about how things had turned out at the time due
to a bad time with the &lt;a href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/t2-years-and-counting-iit-jee.html#entrancexams"&gt;entrance exams&lt;/a&gt; for all the
&lt;a href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/t2-years-and-counting-iit-jee.html#bitsat"&gt;wrong&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/t2-years-and-counting-iit-jee.html#screwup0"&gt;reasons&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress, as time has passed, I have learned to live with my failure a
little better every day, though it still sticks out like a sore thumb on an
otherwise decent academic profile. Despite this, it has been an interesting
exercise is to compare what I expected from college a year ago and reality.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, BITS Pilani (this applies to all campuses, but in this case,
Hyderabad Campus) has some of best internal systems among &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; Indian
colleges. Optional attendance, good grading system, decent infrastructure, and
a lot of freedom is more than what can be asked for in a lot of other colleges.
Despite some glaring flaws such as the lack of a solid technical culture, this
college has punched above its weight for a new institution.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as an engineering utopia? I feel like we are way short of the mark &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/02/aaron_swartz_he_wanted_to_save_the_world_why_couldn_t_he_save_himself.html"&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vz06QO3UkQ&amp;amp;nohtml5=False"&gt;Swartz&lt;/a&gt; mentioned
in his &lt;a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/visitingmit"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Perhaps it’s natural, when doing something so greedy and practical as a
startup, to pine for the idealized world of academia. Its image as a place in
an idyllic location filled with smart people has always been attractive; even
more so with the sense that by being there one can get smarter simply through
osmosis. People describe a place of continual geekiness, of throwing chemicals
into the river and building robots in free time. A magical place for hackers
to just enjoy themselves."&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This aside, I am of the opinion that the version of me a year ago would have
been sorely disappointed by the version of me today. I feel that I was &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;
more hardworking and efficient back at that time. The two years in JEE
preparation were undoubtedly the worst years of my school life but now looking
back, those dark days brought out the best in me in the briefest of
moments. Had I not prepared for JEE at all, I would have had no idea just how driven and hard-working I could be
for a goal that would always be just a touch out of view.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite my frustrations with life during JEE preparation, the epiphanies I
used to have on weekly basis with studying physics kept me going.
It was a positive feedback loop with no goading required. On the other hand I
can't remember the last time I actually enjoyed learning something in class in
this college. I hope it isn't a sign of things to come when I start
"engineering" coursework in my second year but as of now, I have pretty much lost all
motivation to study.  The unbridled enthusiasm I used to have when studying
for the entrance exams and the giddy thoughts of making batshit crazy projects in
college has dwindled. In my first semester, it was a convenient excuse to
blame this on burnout after pushing my limits for two years but I've come to
realize that the reason is probably shallower than that. It's not just with
academics though - wasting time &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; feels painful but I have nothing I
want to do to fill in the gaps. Is there a cause for this? Probably. Have I
figured it out? Absolutely not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like an artificial conflict of time between these misguided academic
pursuits and to actually work on something worthwhile. I could put up with
it in school with the thought that there would be enough free time to pursue
this in college - and while there is - it begs the question why such
artificial restraints on time in the form of exams are always looming in the
first place.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point of time, I don't know what to do. With compre in half a month
but a &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/BYOWdG"&gt;GSoC project&lt;/a&gt; and a couple other projects I've
planned in the pipeline, it's a pretty easy decision to make the choice of
which one of these two things I would want to work on. For a CGPA for which I
cannot care for anymore, it might be one of the worst decisions I can make.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Rants"></category><category term="College"></category><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>GSoC 2016 Project Survey, help me make Dolphin a better File Manager!</title><link href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/gsoc-2016-project-survey-help-me-make.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-02-15T21:16:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Arnav Dhamija</name></author><id>tag:arnavdhamija.com,2016-02-15:blog/gsoc-2016-project-survey-help-me-make.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone!  &lt;/p&gt;

an art than ever before. Thanks to internet photography guides, less light
pollution in uni campus than urban Bangalore, and some more proficiency with
editing software, I've been able to produce more interesting photos than
before. Another thing which I've changed is my stance on editing. Until
recently, I was of the opinion that my photos should be as virgin as possible,
with editing restricted to nothing more than cropping or watermarking. Now, I
subscribe to the more accepting (but still conservative) school of thought:
that editing should be used to bring out the best of an image while keeping
its basic elements intact.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, contradictory to the above, one photography art form I've &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;
enjoyed doing is photography using composite pictures. In composite
photography, the photographer takes several frames of a scene and then
combines all the frames together using special software. I guess my favorite
part about it is the surprise element of the final image - I have no idea what
the output is going to be till I've post-processed the images on my laptop
computer. It's been very early days for me when it comes to composite
photography, but here are a few photos I've felt are worth sharing:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/StarStaX_IMG_9937-IMG_9966_lighten.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/StarStaX_IMG_0095-IMG_0009_gap_filling.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Star trails! I've always wanted to try my hand at astrophotography, but never
could due to Bangalore light pollution and due to not having a camera with
good noise reduction.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two images take advantage of the comparatively lower light pollution in
the campus. These photos are a stacked result of multiple exposures - the
first one combines fifty frames and the second one combines nearly a hundred.
Each frame uses identical settings for the best stacking results.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shot these from midnight till 2am using  laptops for camera tethering and
intervalometer settings. I can't stress on how important having a tripod is
for this - the slightest shift between frames would've given us terrible
discontinuity in the final image. The final images were composited using
&lt;a href="http://www.markus-enzweiler.de/software/software.html"&gt;StarStaX.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}/images/IMG_3689%2B-%2BIMG_3725%2Bresized.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;360 degree panorama image of BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus! Taken from the
middle of the football field, it is a panorama of 33 images stitched using
hugin for Linux. I set up the camera in a portrait orientation with the tripod
and tried to make a composite by overlapping 30-40% of each image. Post
processing felt like it took forever due to the gigantic images and the final
image was a whopping 70.2MP (30000x2404) and is 130 MB large. Although a
couple of frames were shot using the wrong exposure settings, hugin managed to
do a really good job in keeping the differences minimal though there still are
a couple of splotches due to my ineptitude. The uncompressed, full size
version is here: &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/iY5v14"&gt;https://goo.gl/iY5v14&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/mini-planet-footballfield.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little planet picture uses the same panorama as the previous image. It's
a much simpler to post process this with a panorama than it appears. It was
created by resizing the image to a square following a polar coordinate filter
transformation in GIMP to roll the image and to line up the ends. If I had to
do this image again, I would redo it at night with long exposures to give it a
more spacey flavor.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As closing remarks, I'm overall pretty satisfied with how easy it is to make
simple composite pictures using software. I will probably get back into making
more of this again, but probably after I work on &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/"&gt;another
project&lt;/a&gt; ;)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Photography"></category></entry><entry><title>T+2 Years And Counting: My IIT-JEE preparation story</title><link href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/t2-years-and-counting-iit-jee.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-06-17T10:29:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Arnav Dhamija</name></author><id>tag:arnavdhamija.com,2015-06-17:blog/t2-years-and-counting-iit-jee.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the title indicates, it's been a while since I've written anything here.

I've wanted to write about for a while.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, the IIT-JEE is an entrance exam for the IITs which are
regarded by some as the best engineering colleges in India. The exam is held
at the end of 12th grade annually. Hundreds of thousands attempt the exam.
Tens of thousands slog away countless hours of their last few years in high
school preparing for it. Only a few hundred actually succeed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many with some strong aspirations of becoming an engineer, I stumbled
upon this path a couple of years ago. I loved making/breaking things and had
(what I felt) a keen interest in science, so it was a natural option for me to
take some engineering related field over other options. I loved airplanes too
and I would spend many happy hours on Wikipedia reading up about the Concorde
(gorgeous plane), the XB-70, their engines, their airframe designs, and the
engineers behind it all. I was fiercely determined to enter the aviation
industry as an aerospace engineer to create a revolutionary aircraft on the
lines of the Concorde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an unspoken reality that one's chances at IIT-JEE significantly decrease
without the assistance of extra classes outside school, also known as coaching
classes. I joined one at the start of the summer vacation prior to 11th called
FIITJEE after getting a decent fee waiver via their admission test. I was no
stranger to horror stories of 11th and 12th grade for school students, but I
felt things would change for the better after the brain-numbing syllabus of
10th grade.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it did. To an extent. Things passed very quickly through the first few
months of FIITJEE where I was tirelessly trying to understand every fragment
of information that would probably help in making it through with a good rank
in IIT Advance. My math wasn't strongest to begin with and I trudged along
with chem with ambivalence to the subject material. Studying physics, both in
class and at home was amazing. Thanks to our FIITJEE physics teacher, one of
the best teachers I've ever had, physics by acompared long shot became my
favorite subject for the next two years. It always just clicked and moreover
studying physics and learning something new to solve an interesting problem
was just &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;. I remember physics and chemistry (primarily physics) passing
along with relative smoothness but it felt like I was banging my head on a
brick wall with math. This led to the vicious cycle of frustration, studying
to remedy my weaknesses followed by more frustration when things didn't seem
to be getting better. Despite all the apathy towards math I still managed to
get through reasonably well with a consistent 2nd place in the phase tests and
three digit ranks in the FIITJEE AIiTS. Unfortunately my reckless, unplanned
approach towards studying in the first few months cost me greatly in other
spheres of life and I was not a happy person to be around.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was around this point in time when I felt things slipping - yes, decent
ranks in the phase tests were welcome but did it actually mean anything in
such a sample set? There was also a storm brewing on the horizon - in the form
of organic chemistry. Hard as I tried, I could never commit the material to
memory. My woes with organic chem were exemplified with a jaw-dropping 11/25
in a school UT...which meant I had spent about 2 hours studying for every mark
earned in that test :P  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately things slowly shaped up to look better right after 11th grade.
Thanks to some quality teaching at FIITJEE and a lot time with chem textbooks
organic chem started to become clearer for me. Shortly thereafter I managed to
top Bangalore in FIITJEE's classroom program in the organic chem phase test.
Of all the times I've had to bounce back from a tight situation in those 2
years, this was probably my highest point. Suddenly, exactly a year before IIT
Advance 2015, the metaphorical glass was half full and no longer half empty.
There was a calm feeling of conviction of a good possibility of me making it
all the way for a 3 digit rank in IIT. Yes, my math was still well behind
physics and chem but I had a year to work on it, right?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well not exactly. It just so happened that 12th grade started in full flow at
this point and the constant neglect I had given to the school syllabus in 11th
grade was no longer feasible. I couldn't continue just scraping by the school
exams with minimal preparation as I had done in 11th. It dawned on me that I
would have to manage both school and FIITJEE a lot more efficiently if I had
to have a chance with making it to a good college. While physics was chugging
along well, math severely needed a shot in the arm and chem got a whole lot
uglier with 4 (or was it 5?) full organic chapters hastily finished off in
FIITJEE just days before phase test 4. The neglect with the other two subjects
was all too visible with me scoring 20 marks more in physics than chem and
math combined (no I'm not a savant in physics, just an idiot with math :P). In
the middle of all this, a few competitive programming experiences realigned my
goals with respect to computer science and I started liking it almost as much
as I used to obsess with aerospace engineering in the past.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="screwup0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
For me, this turned into the beginning of a massive decline. For whatever
reason, I succeeded in trashing both the KVPY and the NSEP - my biggest
targets for 12th grade. School marks were about okay, but still less than
ideal. Not in a great shape right now, huh? It proceeded to get worse when on
one day in December 2014 I heard the news that because of my US citizenship, I
was essentially out of the race for NITs, IIITs (note I was still in the
running for IITs though) and a bunch of local colleges in Karnataka as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Godammit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My passion for physics notwithstanding I might as well not have studied at all
for IIT till then. It was a pretty big blow. Fortunately, what the government
taketh, they giveth. I could make it to NITs through their international
program (DASA) solely through subject SAT scores which shouldn't be to big of
a deal given all the study towards JEE. If you've been reading this closely,
you would have probably guessed that even that wasn't exactly straightforward
since the only available day to attempt the subject SAT before the deadline
was December 6, exactly a week after I heard about this scheme. The subject
SATs themselves were uneventful - 2400. Incidentally, at this time math
finally seemed to be shaping up for the first time since I chanced upon this
business with FIITJEE. I could reasonably solve problems when in the mood
which was a big change from how I used to dawdle with the subject earlier.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did I know that is was the beginning of the biggest low I experienced -
school pre-boards in January 2015 was an unmitigated disaster. 55% in math and
about the same in chem with similarly bad marks across the board in CSc,
physics, and English made for some very unpleasant conversations with my
parents. Forget about JEE, at that point, even making the 80% in boards for
qualifying cutoff was looking distant. Intertwined in this was the new BITS
Hyderabad international admissions program which also made use of the good
subject SAT score! But the twist was that they needed SAT reasoning scores too - which left me (yet again) with no option to attempt it within a week's time
after the pre-boards to make the deadline. Gave it my all - 2220 overall or
1580/1600 CR+Math. With some assurance of BITS Hyderabad, college entrance
exams totally took a backseat from the beginning of this year, the primary
focus from then on being the board exams.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a lot of effort to get started - those pre-board marks were not going
to fix themselves and I had to make up almost the full year's syllabus in a
bit more than a month to stand a chance. Eventually, the rote-learning mode
grew on me and the board exams came and went in March without too much drama.
Just the day before my last board exam, BITS Hyderabad sent an offer letter
for taking up CSc at an 80% scholarship! For a few sweet minutes the pressure
of the last two years was off.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="entrancexams"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
If you haven't slept off yet reading through all that, here's where it started
to get interesting. Board exams done and dusted left me free to attempt the
set of entrance exams at will - the main ones being JEE Mains/Advance and the
BITSAT. With BITS Hyderabad CSc, I was of the opinion things could only get
better as I could attempt all the exams with a free mind. This went on to be
reasonably true - starting off with JEE Mains on the second Friday of April 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached the center a few minutes late. Strangely, there was only a mild sensation of tension in the air. Maybe I had become completely desensitised to pressure after the board exams?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after filling in the formalities, I took my seat in front of the exam computer. I logged in and started off with physics as I always did during the phase tests. The beginning wasn't quite what I expected, but after the rest of physics felt smooth. As always, there were some questions I was kicking myself for not answering because I had forgotten some formulae. At 72 minutes in, I felt like there wasn't much more I could do with physics, so I moved onto chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemistry didn't feel too shabby either. It was littered throughout with exception based questions with weird products and numericals, but I wasn't too fazed. What fazed me was yet to come - the math section. At 100 minutes into the paper, having finished physics and chemistry, I was feeling pretty good thinking I had at least 150 marks up till this point. I took a 5 minute break and stretched my arms. Right after this reverie, I started with what I knew was going to be the worst part of the exam. The first few questions in math didn't seem unsolvable, but with every passing question, it became quite clear that I would be guessing most of this section. I flipped back and forth between physics and chemistry hoping that there would be a question or two I could salvage instead of wasting time on math. There really wasn't much left to do in physics and chem, so I just eliminated whatever options I could in a few math questions and submitted the paper about 5 minutes early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks later I found out that I had picked up 206/360 in JEE Mains with a solid 88/120 in physics, 83/120
in chem, and 35/120 (:P) in math. Though I would've hoped for it bit more, it
turned out to be a better score than I thought it would be as the cutoffs had
dropped by 10 marks from the previous year and that very few in my batch had
scored higher. Much later on, it transpired that this JEE Mains score with my
95+% in CBSE would give me a decent shot at getting CSc at NIT, Surathkal
campus, Aerospace Engineering at IISt, and hell, even decent choices at IIIT-H
had it not been for my US citizenship. With this Mains result in hand, it led
me to a crucial decision - study for the BITSAT and go for it all to get CSc
at Pilani campus? Study for JEE Advance instead to salvage a decent rank
especially since BITS unifies their curriculum across campuses? I decided to
go for the BITSAT - after all my math was in no condition for the brunt of JEE
Advance but I had a good shot of making up to a respectable level for the
BITSAT, which is an objectively much easier exam.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="bitsat"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
This quickly turned into an obsession - with a BITSAT textbook by my side I
started optimising and gaming the whole test to the minute with well divided
time sections for all the subjects and strategies for almost all the possible
outcomes at each stage. Math felt like it was finally on par with the other
two subjects. With strong 350-370 scores after attempting all the questions in
all the mock tests without the bonus 12 questions, it looked like that the
dream of two years was finally within my grasp.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, for some inexplicable reason, I felt tremendous pressure just hours
before the exam when I should have been getting a sound sleep. It was awful
and I only managed to catch a few hours of sleep after finally going to sleep
at 2am on the day of the exam scheduled at 830am.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sleep deprivation didn't augur well but that only partially sealed my
fate. The invigilator gave me more rough paper than I was supposed to be given
before the exam (the two rough booklets were somehow glued back to back), only
to realize his mistake when I started the math section.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This can't be happening&lt;/em&gt;, I thought. &lt;em&gt;This isn't how it's supposed to all
end.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My extra rough sheets were confiscated by the proctor and then it hit me that
this really was the final nail in the coffin. At that very moment the blood
drained from my face realising that my chances were slipping by the second.
With 90 minutes left to go but with no rough paper I was very much on the
verge of giving up knowing that it really couldn't be worse. Math was never my
strongest subject but attempting it without any rough paper was completely out
of the question. Despite all this, I realized that I couldn't just let a dream
of 2 years fall apart for such a pathetic issue and still went on with the
test - guessing everything I could on the math section.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went for the extra 12 questions which were fine but I knew that the damage
done from fluking most of math was irreparable. With the most anxiety I've
ever experienced, I clicked the "Submit Test" button to see how I had done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your score: 307&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was later revised to 311; 118/43&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WTF&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely it was just my sleep deprived brain that was seeing things, right? I
rubbed my eyes, half expecting the last two digits of the score to reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened my eyes again. No change. Then I glanced towards the bottom of the
screen and then I knew I had truly screwed the pooch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correct: 117&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorrect: 44&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Correctly marked answers are worth 3 marks and incorrectly marked answers
lose 1 mark from the total)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled out of the exam room/computer lab feeling absolutely numb. Speech
was difficult without a torrent of tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BITS Pilani CSc, heck, CSc at any BITS campus through BITSAT was an
impossibility. It felt crushing and terrible to work so hard and to get so
close only to ruin everything on the day of the exam for some issue that I had
no control over. That day was not the first time I cried myself to sleep in
those two years, but at least in those times there was a silver lining in getting another
chance to do well in some other exam. There was no other exam left to do well in this time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strangely the only solace at the time was that I had to give JEE Advance (is
it spelled Advanced? My bad if it's wrong) with absolutely no preparation due
to preparing for the BITSAT instead. So, I ended up with only three days to
prepare for JEE Advance and did nothing more than three previous year's papers
to make sure I wasn't wasting time on any particular section and to ensure I
hadn't lost too much touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24 May 2015 was the day. I knew I was going to be in serious trouble before
even opening the question paper - the cover page of the question paper itself
indicated that the next three hours were going to be pure torture with a
ridiculous +4/-2 marking scheme on multiple correct option questions (this
means more than one of the given MCQ options could be correct and failing to
mark all the correct options would make one lose 2 marks), +4/0 integer type
(think: a free response question with values from 0-9), and +2/-1 match the
following (which is a whole lot more sinister than it sounds when you realise
that MORE than one option in a column can be mapped to the other and all the
correct options are required to be marked). It was a blur - all I remember was
being completely deflated and slightly relieved that my ordeal only had
another three hours with Paper 2 which followed a very similarly brutal
marking scheme. I felt like I was in with a chance after doing the 2014 and
2012 question papers but there was no way I could squeeze out a good score
with this. It was a bittersweet feeling after the those long 6 hours - sweet
to think that the sweat and toil of the last two years was finally over and
bitter to see how everything concerning my given entrance exams had fallen
apart in the last week. The first thing I did on getting home from the exam
was to sit down in the garden, on the grass and slowly piece together what
exactly had happened. There were no tears as there had been for making a mess
of the BITSAT - just a quiet resignation and mild shock that dreams had been
shattered for good.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, I'm stuck at the difficult decision with taking BITS Hyderabad CSc
BE or trying for a dual degree program at BITS Goa, taking physics and
eventually CSc.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, that's easily been the longest single piece of writing I've ever done. I
typed most of it on my phone on the plane, so apologies if it doesn't make too
much sense. If you've made it all the way here, thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="JEE"></category><category term="Life"></category></entry><entry><title>Midnight Photography!</title><link href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/midnight-photography.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-23T12:23:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Arnav Dhamija</name></author><id>tag:arnavdhamija.com,2013-04-23:blog/midnight-photography.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey guys! I haven't been able to get too many scenic shots of late, so I've
invested some of my photography time in taking photos at night. Here are some
of the shots that I've recently taken with my camera.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_0131.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like employing this technique. You need to get someone to hold a
torch while the camera is mounted on a tripod. The shutter was open for 15
seconds, ample time to draw the chosen letters. It works great for pseudo stop
motion too!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_0790.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, I honestly admit that I didn't expect a shot like this! It was a simple
matter to shoot it by mounting the camera and leaving the shutter open for a
few seconds. The depth of field is stellar and I think the purple backdrop
gives a nice setting to the scene. My only gripe with this photo is that there
are too many buildings in between and that it would've looked much better if I
had shot it from around 50m above ground level.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other pictures you see are of the moon (if you haven't realized already :)
) These photos were taken over different days in the span of a few months and
hence, the lighting changes considerably. My camera isn't a champion performer
under low light conditions and the digital noise at high ISOs is evident. But
I'll leave that to you to judge. I tried my best in obtaining relatively clear
images (which is a pretty difficult feat when the camera's digital focal
length is 2240 mm!)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_2268.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Recently bought myself some free time to publish a brand new blog
post, centred on my photography work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I also owe all of my avid readers an apology: it's been a really long
time since my last photography post, so I hope I can make it up to you in this
one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My previous photography posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/photography-volume-3"&gt;Volume 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/photography-volume-2"&gt;Volume 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/photography"&gt;Volume 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, just click to enlarge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting off:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_1013.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really in need of an anthropologist here. I found this insect whilst
walking down the road when a speck of orange caught my eye. Turns out that
that speck of orange is one of the finest six-legged creatures I've ever seen.
From a photography stand-point, I used a wide aperture, and a large zoom to
capture this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_2608.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably one of the most comical insect/bug pictures that I've ever
taken. The DoF worked excellently over here; it only puts the subject in
focus. The first thing that came to my mind after I shot this was "suicide".
Definitely one of my favourite shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_4283.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay, another bug! I'm really scared of wasps, but that's the good thing about
a superzoom camera: you can stand far away and still get a crisp shot. Pretty
much the same ingredients were used to make this shot as the previous two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_4286.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should really call this post "Bugs and Insects Special Album!" or something.
Poor jokes aside, I love the way the insect was climbing on the stigma/anthers
(not too sure) of the flower. The background is sublimely blurred, but there's
still enough detail to keep the background interesting. Top shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_4301.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one picture I really like, but sometimes I feel remorseful seeing it.
Although the reptile is in excellent focus, the handle of the water tap to the
right distracts attention from it. Just goes to show that you can't always
expect perfect conditions for photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_4564.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No photography album is complete without a good flower. This is easily one of
the prettiest flowers I've ever shot. Although I'm not too happy with the
background, the foreground more than makes up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_4382.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're probably sick of seeing close-ups now, so I thought I'd throw in this
picture that I took at sunset.  Everything worked in this photo, the orange
clouds, the lovely Tyndall effect coming from the sun, and the coconut trees
below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_4479.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another close-up! If I had to pass any comment about this, I would point out
the robin's leisurely stride. It seems so relaxed, almost as if in a dream-
like trance. Never mind my comments, post your own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_4845.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like this one. It's a very personified shot, the way the bird on the
left is trying to say something, and the one on the right is taciturn and
unwilling to respond. Their seating on the rocks is perfect and I also like
the way they chose to pose right in front of the water-body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_4884.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_4892.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry if I've made you wince by showing you another insect picture (it has
been enough of those!). Nevertheless, I'm really proud about taking these
shots. They're both images of the same dragonfly from different angles. The
first one has a nice background and excellent detail, while the second one
exhibits a minimalistic appearance, with little to distract from the dragonfly
itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now! Please criticize, praise, and comment!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Photography"></category></entry><entry><title>Photography Protips!</title><link href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/photography-protips.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-09-09T20:26:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Arnav Dhamija</name></author><id>tag:arnavdhamija.com,2012-09-09:blog/photography-protips.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Gosh, does time fly. It's been months since my last blog post, owing quite a
bit to 10th grade and other activities. However, I'm back with a new, special
post on what makes me tick behind the lens!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take this as my guide to hobbyist digital photography. I hope you enjoy it!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find something interesting to photograph:&lt;/em&gt; While this might sound obvious, this is probably one of the most difficult things to accomplish in photography. A photo is a work of art: it needs to convey feelings, emotions, and beauty. If you don't have anything which can capture any of those three important guidelines, chances are you will end up with a dull photo. Photography isn't all about luscious landscapes or crafted close-ups. If you have a good degree of imagination, you can make anything look like a professional grade photograph, which brings me to my second point.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be imaginative:&lt;/em&gt; It's good to have a hard drive worth of photos shot at landmarks all over the world, but to be honest, you don't need that to be a good photographer. Imagination is probably the best thing that can change a common photo into a modern masterpiece. Just look outside your window. If you look closely and carefully for long enough, you'll definitely find something that can make an excellent photograph. Mess around with perspectives and your camera's settings and shutter times, and see what you get!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You don't need the best camera to take good photos:&lt;/em&gt; Don't get me wrong here, you're never going to get a high-grade photo from your 5-year old smartphone's camera. However, while it is no myth that a Canon 5D Mark III will consistently outperform your handy digital point-and-shoot camera, there's so much more to photography than just the camera and lens. Photographers need to have a good eye for detail and if you're not blessed with that, you can say farewell to all the awesome photos you thought you were going to shoot with your new DSLR. Having an eye for detail results in some wonderful photographs even with the most mediocre of cameras. I wouldn't call my Canon SX1-IS PowerShot (the camera which I've used to photograph all the photos posted on this blog) mediocre: it's actually a pretty good digital prosumer, but it's true that there are a huge bunch of DSLRs which exceed it in image quality.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you are fortunate enough to own a high-end camera and you have a
passion for photography, chances are that you will be shooting like a pro in
no time. A lower end camera won't offer you all the advanced features a
prosumer/DSLR offers, but it'll do just fine for capturing most photos. Don't
forget to keep lighting in mind, lighting conditions are very detrimental to
taking good photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn about your camera:&lt;/em&gt; This is very important. You might say, "Hey, my camera's got a brilliant Automatic mode, I don't need to learn about nerdy photography terms!" While it is true to an extent that camera nowadays are getting smarter and are able to deliver quality pictures even with minimal adjustment, you should learn about photography lingo right after you get comfortable with your camera. Why do you need to get comfortable first? That's because getting swamped with all the things you need to know to photograph with reasonable quality, isn't really the best way to start off your career in photography.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to give you a quick example, learn about terms such as: f-stops for
Aperture, Shutter Speed (both are very important), ISO Film, digital noise,
chromatic aberration, focal lengths, light metering, and the golden
combination of all these things that make a good photo! A good photographer
needs to thoroughly understand and know all these things to figure out how
each one affects one another. Although it may seem daunting at first, I can
tell you from personal experience that all it needs is just a few rounds of
taking photos for one hour and a little bit of reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Get out there!:&lt;/em&gt; Photos are never going to shoot themselves You need to be behind the camera and you need to be ready to experiment a lot to have a collection of quality photographs. It can seem impossible to take a good photo at times, but not everything can be photographed just the way you might want it to be. Learn from your own experiences and read up on how you can improve. I can safely bet with you that your experience will teach you more about photography than I, or any book can!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've been patient enough to read all this, I wish you the best of luck in
diving into the wonderful world of digital photography!  &lt;/p&gt;

blog: just eight days! Today also represents the 1st anniversary of this blog,
and hence, I present my new photography album.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of you would have already seen &lt;a href="/photography-volume-2"&gt;Volume
2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/photography"&gt;Volume
1&lt;/a&gt;, so you probably
have an idea of my photography skills. I can only say that my skills have
improved since then, as you will see in these photos.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these photos were shot in either Aperture Priority (Av) or Shutter
Speed Priority (Tv) modes, a step forward from shooting in  Program (P) mode.
I like exercising full control over the camera, though the camera does a
better job than me in choosing shutter speeds for apertures, so Av is the mode
of choice.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical chatter aside; the photos (click to enlarge):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_6748.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start off with this. A rare shot with two animals. I can't offer any
opinion as to why the squirrel didn't run away from there or why the bird
landed there in the first place, but using a wide aperture and high zoom did
wonders here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_6770.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another squirrel? Well, actually it's the same one as in the previous picture.
I'm at the risk of repeating photos over here, but this shot was way too good
to pass up. The dark area which you see to the right of the image actually
gives this photo a subtle effect and the squirrel's pose is fantastic. Using a
digital camera gave me a wide choice of focal lengths without much adjustment.
This one is 929 mm equivalent on a 35 mm film. Used f-stop 5.7 here, because
wider apertures are beyond the camera's potential at these focal lengths.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_6799.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty nice shot here as well. It looks like a macro shot, but this one was
shot from afar. The sunflower looks great here, and the tiny ladybug on the
petals is the icing on the cake (or should I say flower?). The background was
perfectly suited for this shot, and gives a nice empty space for this photo.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_6817.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't lie to you by saying that this picture was taken at a different
location from the previous one. I like the bee's placement in the flower and
the flower itself. The flies and the varieties of insects that adorn the
flower also look good over here. The background is one of my favourite parts
of this photo, with details blurred to put emphasis on the main flower, but
visible at the same time. It's a hard balance to maintain, but I'm glad that
it worked over here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_6972.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing special about the photography techniques over here, but photographing
another creature, and a reptile at that was too good to pass up.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_7304.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose the colour over here is the main part of the photo. Clarity and
contrast are also impressive. The flower itself looks exotic enough, though I
have no idea what it is. Flowers are probably the best subjects in
photography. They are quite beautiful, move very little and you can try a
hundred different exposures to get the right shot.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_7327.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I'll be mean to call this an ugly butterfly (I'm sure it's not a moth!),
I think it looks magnificent over here. Although eye-pleasing colours are
practically non-existent in this photo, you should look at the contrast of the
ground to the insect. It looks pretty good, and the other insects around the
butterfly provide a level of detail, without which, this photo would look much
plainer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="{filename}/images/IMG_7331.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably one of the best shots I took on that day. The coconut as a subject
may make you raise eyebrows, but it's totally unlike anything else I've shot.
The focusing was perfect here, giving the photo a very small depth of field.
Less can be more and this shot exemplifies it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_7583.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might've seen that I've only done close-up shots. This is one of the very
few landscape shots I've taken. Excellent scenery and I really don't have much
more to say about this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_7843.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mynah had a nice stance and perching position for this. The background is
suitably blurred over here and the foreground falls into focus nicely. The
background is great for this and the bird's details are captured with some
success.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_8064.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might look odd to photograph only the head of a peacock without its
resplendent body. But the head itself actually has fantastic detail. The blue
colour stands out superbly and there is a generous amount of empty space in
the photo which is essential for greater emphasis on the bird. An unorthodox,
but great shot.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it folks! (I have no idea why I quoted that)  &lt;/p&gt;

liked. It's not about time (or the lack of it), it's just laziness. Well, a
lot of stuff has happened this month (and a lot of pics have been taken),
which I simply can't do justice to by putting it in words.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose, I've found a new love as well, some people are going to hate
this...  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/Pokemon-PNG-Pic.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...well actually it's not a new love, this dates back to 2004, so I'll
narrate my history with this incredible video-game.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2004 when I was only 6 years-old, I was everything one could describe
as a Pokemon fan. I used to watch the anime a lot, watched all the released
movies, and even had Pokemon drawing and colouring books. In 2005, I was
introduced to the world of Pokemon video-games, which I never knew existed. I
remember how popular Pokemon used to be in my apartment complex, it was as if
a GameBoy Advance and a Pokemon cartridge was like a piece of clothing, which
you could not &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have when going outside. The rage was infectious, and I
soon caught on. I got my first Pokemon game as a birthday gift - Pokemon
Sapphire.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with great exuberance, I got my first Gym badge, saved my game and went to
bed. The next day when I woke up, and loaded the game, I was greeted with this
message:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/deleted-file.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serious disappointment. I tried saving again, but got the same message. I
thought my Pokemaster career had come to a standstill, which it actually had.
So, for the next few months, all I could do was gaze in envy at my friends'
games which actually saved. Why only for a few months? Because, in February
2006, I got an original FireRed. With the same anxiousness, I tried saving,
and obviously (but to my surprise), it actually worked! Joy. What followed was
me getting an original Emerald as well, so I knew my career was well on its
way. It was a lot of fun, when we were allowed to bring our GameBoys to
school, and see whose Level 100 Mewtwo was better. I must clocked at least a
total of 600 hours on both games, but in the middle of 2007, I was hit by a
GameBoy ban, which didn't end till summer 2008. By then, I totally lost
interest, and the GameBoy took its place as being a convenient paperweight and
dust collector. Never touched it again for three years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2011, some of my friends came over with their GameBoys to ask me some
Pokemon questions and how to get to Navel Rock without a GameShark. Of course,
I had lost most of my expertise on the subject, and we never got to Navel
Rock. But then, it brought back to me the fond memories of playing Pokemon,
and thinking "Hey, this is fun!". The very next day, I downloaded an emulator
and Emerald ROM, just to relive those moments.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was brilliant, playing Pokemon on that queer low-resolution and basic
pseudo-2.5D models. I couldn't care less about the life-like graphics in other
games. This was for me. I frantically hunted for my FireRed and Emerald
cartridges, but both of them were lost. Lost forever. It was a heart-breaking
moment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, I began trawling sites like Bulbapedia and Serebii, to catch up on
what I missed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was an awful lot. But, looking closer, I saw a very sharp competitive edge
to the game. I was amazed, and soon after, I swallowed the concept of EVs,
IVs, and natures.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded Pokemon Platinum and DS emulator for fun. I never thought I would
actually play it. I couldn't have been more wrong. I played the whole game and
beat the Battle Frontier with all my newly-gained knowledge.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But soon, I realised, there's no way of playing with a real person like this.
So, I (nervously) asked my parents for a DS + Pokemon Black (I would've never
asked, if I hadn't got scholarship). But that was easily the best things I
could ever buy. A Cosmo Black 3DS and Pokemon Black. All I could've ever
wanted. I've played around 70 Wi-Fi battles, and won like 30 of them. I turned
to sites like &lt;a href="http://smogon.com/"&gt;Smogon&lt;/a&gt;. It was incredible, a whole
community of smart, competitive Pokemon players. It was just the place for me.
A few months ago, I became a member, and my Pokemon journey continues to
advance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's my story. Hope you guys liked it.

shot, I present to you, my viewers, my new photography album. The old
collection can be found
&lt;a href="/photography"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: not all my photos here are "new, new" photos. Some of them are
exceptional shots I took before publishing my last post, but I didn't want to
post two pics of the same thing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on....(click to enlarge)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_5317.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A really neat pose of that squirrel. I didn't expect the sunlight and the
ground to merge so well together.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_5391.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like it's been pulled out of a rainforest. The truth is, i found these
little birds in my backyard. I love the way the birds sit linearly, almost
like a family picture.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_5575.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a bit of an experiment, with very impressive results. Shot it under
low lighting with flash at a certain angle, so you can see all the layers of
petals in the flower.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_5696.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slimy snail; and although the picture doesn't exhibit too many photography
techniques, it looks pretty decent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_5935.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grasshopper/mantis (I'm no entomologist) strikes an excellent pose for
this photo. The raised forearms and the spread out legs give it a great
stance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_6043.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A really simple pic, but that's what makes it look detailed and elegant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_6066.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cute little birdie. That sounds really stupid. Anyway, I like the perching
position of the bird, and the contrast of its black head to its yellow body
(sorry if that sounds racist). Birds and insects seem to love posing for me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_6149.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, this picture was an absolute stunner for me. I heard the cat screeching
in pain before I found it (probably "cat"fighting). The way its body is
silhouetted and the light gleaming off the feline's eyes make it an amazing
and thoughtful picture.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_6164.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of a filler pic. The flower looks pretty, and I can't say much about
this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_5639.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect pose + perfect clarity + cool insect = awesomeness. The macro worked
exceptionally well here.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_6177.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of good timing, this picture was taken early in the morning. The
bees seemed to be rising with me and the sharpness in front and the blurred
out background, make it another sweet shot.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_6199.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have enough words to describe how much I love this one. At a first
glance, you might not see much, but look at the thing looming over the moth's
(yes it is a moth) body. Do you count four legs a side? Yup, a spider was
ingesting its prey in this one, and seeing it in real life was eerie. Although
I can't bring out all the life or death in this photo, I hope you get the
message.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you'll enjoy these photos, no need to hope.  &lt;/p&gt;

downs. Viewing from not an expert's position, not from a parent's position,
not from a teacher's position, but from a high school, bored student's
perspective, this post is just a rant about our muddled education system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CCE&lt;/strong&gt;: This was supposed to be the next big thing to do away with exams.
However, the government's magic wand failed to do much on these counts, and
instead of doing away with exams, it succeeded to give us a cornucopia of
projects and assignments, to keep us busy in our already syncopated free time.
It probably could've done a lot more if they had revised their assessment,
but.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emphasis on exams&lt;/strong&gt;: What the education board has largely taught the
majority of Indian students is that failure in exams is tantamount to failure
in life. It screams to say that exams are the most important thing that could
have happened since the Big Bang, and that failing could just as well result
in the destruction of the universe itself. It would be an understatement to
say that "10th graders in India suicide", because the existence threatening
virus has got to almost all age groups. For the sake of lives, try to change
these stereotypes, CBSE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of thinking problems&lt;/strong&gt;: OK, I know what my fellow students are thinking on
these counts in math (no pun intended), but problems like these are reserved
for "higher classes". It's like slowly walking on a long path and then being
forced to run a marathon. Yeah, these problems can't be left out early for the
benefit of the "average student". Sure, it is tough going early, but it will
pay off in the end. The bar of the "average student" needs to be raised a
notch higher on the metaphoric ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more evidence, just look at India's IMO (International
Mathematics Olympiad) rating of 72nd out of 73 countries. An average South
Korea's 3rd grader is astonishingly  just as good as an average Indian 8th
grader at mathematical/mental ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hindi&lt;/strong&gt;: As if the subject wasn't terrifying enough, some wise guy decided to
give kids 15 chapters of boredom and then ask arbitrary questions in exams.
With themes ranging from dirt, mud and random biographies, the Hindi syllabus
clearly wasn't reviewed by a person brought up in a ubiquitous English
community. If CBSE can reduce the bar so nonchalantly for sciences, why was
this treatment skipped for Hindi?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uniformed board&lt;/strong&gt;: This probably saves a lot of confusion, but it means that it
needs to cater to all types of society for what the board considers
"relevant". Things like forestry and agriculture are hardly needed in urban
areas, but then again, this is according to me, not them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policies&lt;/strong&gt;: Read plural of policy and not law enforcing officers. RTE plans to
give education to everyone, which sounds like a nice idea, but in reality is
far-fetched. With most 3rd graders failing to pass basic English reading tests
(94% to be exact), something seems to be wrong. Even if they somehow do get
everyone educated, not everyone can get a job in this country, leaving lots of
wasted talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more positive note, literacy rates have jumped by over 12% since 2001's
census. Great news, but these shortcomings give one some food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;

the very name of this blog itself. Yes, we reached the population landmark of
7,000,000,000 or seven billion according to a UN estimate. According to me
population growth is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a good trend and achieving it has some serious
implications. The world is already ridden with poverty, AIDS and a host of
problems with which the majority of the population can not keep up with. Sure,
we have more people and man-force. But that doesn't help the fact that unlike
population, resources do not reproduce by themselves. Providing for seven
billion odd people is more than what the earth can give.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a breakdown of the world's population growth.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is positive information. The world has only added one billion people in
13 years since the last milestone of six billion. More people would probably
mean higher growth rates. It's not happened in this case due to successful
campaigns from the Chinese - 400 million less births. However, even with the
current growth rate, it will not be sustainable to have more people on this
planet in a few decades.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why thee vile insect, must consume min winsome flower? (old English, just for
the heck of it)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_5134.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this photo. Super macro, so the spider was almost touching the lens of
the cam. Came out really well though.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_5115.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much to say, but like the colours of this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_5306.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timing is the essence of photography. Looks good as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_5342.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite bugs; the millipede. The revolting insect was dangling
from a twig when I captured it (sounds like pokemon there).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_5366.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could have put a bit more emphasis on the bird, but the flowers gave the
picture a nice setting,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://arnavdhamija.com/images/IMG_5407.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pretty good shot to get it in that pose. Over-exposed (+2) I think, but
that puts the bird in the spotlight.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you like the photos. Review and comment.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Photography"></category></entry><entry><title>'The 1 = Everything' equation</title><link href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/1-everything-equation.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-09-21T13:57:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Arnav Dhamija</name></author><id>tag:arnavdhamija.com,2011-09-21:blog/1-everything-equation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What's your unlucky number?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"13", say some people  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nooo, 4", say the others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My unlucky number's 1. Yup.  The closest whole number to zero really sucks for
me. Cricket: Lost by 1 run. Badminton: 20-21 (no deuces). It's pretty much
everywhere. More so from a competitive exam viewpoint: NSO, IMO, IAIS, they've
all gone up in smoke because of 1 mark. But that really doesn't compare to my
worst defeat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infosys CTY.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pretty happy with myself till I got to know of the top six. I couldn't
believe it, so I stormed into the co-coordinator's room.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"How much did I get", I asked.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After fumbling a bit, she said I got 18/20. I didn't know how that could
disqualify me because everyone else got 18/20 as well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I could've chosen you instead of anyone of the other six. But your mistake,
well, I can't pardon that."  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had messed up on the easiest question in that paper: "What's 25% of 25%?". I
decided not to argue. It really hurt that I screwed up on that. Every morning
for a few months I woke up with the same question, "What good am I in anything
else, if I can't even make it to the top six in my school?".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scars don't fade easily, and this one didn't heal till a month ago.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it: 'The 1 = Everything' equation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Rants"></category></entry><entry><title>After the exams...</title><link href="http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/after-exams.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-09-20T19:39:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Arnav Dhamija</name></author><id>tag:arnavdhamija.com,2011-09-20:blog/after-exams.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, today concluded a week's long affair of exertion.

probably out of laziness that I couldn't bring myself to update it either.
With the advent of Pokemon Platinum on the emulator, factor the time I want to
spend on this to zero.  &lt;/p&gt;
