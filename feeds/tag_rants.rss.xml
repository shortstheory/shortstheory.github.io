&lt;p&gt;I had postponed a lot of introspection during the two years I spent slogging
away for the JEE. But now, with ample free time and practically no requirement
to go to classes, I've finally got some time to look …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Arnav Dhamija</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2016 01:38:00 +0530</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:arnavdhamija.com,2016-04-14:/blog/what-do-i-do-now.html</guid><category>Rants</category><category>College</category><category>Life</category></item><item><title>Rantings: Indian Education</title><link>http://arnavdhamija.com/blog/rantings-indian-education.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The Indian education system has been one with many &lt;strike&gt;ups and&lt;/strike&gt;
downs. Viewing from not an expert's position, not from a parent's position,
not from a teacher's position, but from a high school, bored student's
perspective, this post is just a rant about our muddled education system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Nooo, 4", say the others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My unlucky number's 1. Yup.  The closest whole number to zero really sucks for
me. Cricket: Lost by 1 run. Badminton: 20-21 (no deuces). It's pretty much
everywhere. More so from a competitive exam viewpoint: NSO, IMO …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Arnav Dhamija</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2011 13:57:00 +0530</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:arnavdhamija.com,2011-09-21:/blog/1-everything-equation.html</guid><category>Rants</category></item></channel></rss>
