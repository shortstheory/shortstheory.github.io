            <p>That’s it. After a <a href="https://github.com/KDE/kio-
stash/graphs/contributors">combined total</a> of 217 git commits, 6,202 lines of code added, and
4,167 lines of code deleted, GSoC 2016 is finally over.  </p>

<p>These twelve weeks of programming have been a very enriching experience for me
and making this project has taught me a lot about production quality software
development. Little did I know that a <a href="https://github.com/shortstheory/filetray-very-early-alpha-idea-
thingy">small
project</a> I had put together in a 6 hour session of messing around with Qt would
lead to something as big as this!  </p>
<p>There have been many memorable moments throughout my coding period for the
GSoC - such as the first time I got an ioslave to
<a href="http://arnavdhamija.blogspot.in/2016/05/gsoc-
update-1-beginning.html">install</a> correctly, to writing its “Hello World”
<a href="http://arnavdhamija.blogspot.in/2016/06/gsoc-update-writing-kio-
slave-101.html">equivalent</a>, and getting a basic implementation of the project up and
running by doing a series of dirty hacks with Dolphin’s code. There were also
times when I was so frustrated with debugging for this project, that I wanted
to do nothing but smash my laptop’s progressively failing display panel with
the largest hammer I could find. The great mentorship from my GSoC mentor and
the premise of the GSoC program itself kept me going. This also taught me an
important lesson with regards to software development - no one starting out
gets it right on their first try. It feels like after a long run of not quite
getting the results I wanted, the GSoC is the thing which worked out for me as
everything just fell into place.  </p>
<p>There’s a technical digression here, which you can feel free to skip through
if you don’t want to get into the details of the project.  </p>
<p>Following up from the <a href="http://arnavdhamija.blogspot.in/2016/07/gsoc-
update-tinkering-with-kio.html">previous</a> blog post, with the core features of the
application complete, I had moved on to unit testing my project. For this
project, unit testing involved writing test cases for each and every component
of the application to find and fix any bugs. Despite the innocuous name, unit
testing this project was a much bigger challenge than I expected. As for one
thing, the ioslave in my project is merely a controller in the MVC system of
the virtual Stash File System, the Dolphin file manager, and the KIO Slave
itself. Besides, most of the ioslave’s functions have a void return type, so
feeding the slave’s functions’ arguments to get an output for checking was not
an option either.  </p>
<p>This led me to use an approach, which my mentor aptly called “black box
testing”.  </p>
<p>In this approach, one writes unit tests testing for a specific action and then
checking for whether the effects of the said action are as expected. In this
case, the ioslave was tested by giving it a test file and then apply some of
the ioslave’s functions such as copy, rename, delete, and stat. From there,
through a bunch of QVERIFY calls is to check whether the ioslave has completed
the operation successfully. Needless to say, this approach is far more
convoluted to write unit tests for as it required checking each and every test
file for its properties in every test case. Fortunately, the
<a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qtestlib-manual.html#qtestlib">QTestLib</a> API is
pretty well documented so it wasn’t difficult to get started with writing unit
tests. I also had a template of what a good test suite should look like thanks
to David Faure’s excellent work on implementing automated unit testing for the
Trash ioslave. With these two tools in hand, I started off with writing unit
tests shortly before the second year of college started.  </p>
<p>As expected, writing black box unit tests was a PITA in its own right. The
first time I ran my unit test I came up with a dismal score of 6 unit tests
passed out of the 17 I had written. This lead me to go back and check whether
my unit tests were testing correctly at all. It turned out that I had made so
many mistakes with writing the unit tests that an entire rewrite of the test
suite wasn’t unwarranted.  </p>
<p>With a rewrite of the test cases completed, I ran the test suite again. The
results were a bit better - 13 out of the 17 test cases passed, but 4 failed
test cases - enough reason for the project to be unshippable. Looking into the
issue a bit deeper, I found out that all the D-Bus calls to my ioslave for
copy and move operations were not working correctly! Given that I had spent so
much time on making sure the ioslave was robust enough, this was a mixed
surprise. Finally, after a week of rewriting and to an extent, refactoring the
rename and copy functions of the ioslave, I got the best terminal output I
ever wanted from this project.  </p>

<p>Definitely the highest point of the GSoC for me. From there on out, it was a
matter of putting the code on the slow burner for cleaning up any leftover
debug statements and for writing documentation for other obscure sections.
With a net total of nearly 2000 lines of code, it far surpasses any other
project I’ve done in terms of size and quality of code written.  </p>
<p>At some points in the project, I felt that the stipend was far too generous,
for many people working on KDE <em>voluntarily</em> produce projects much larger
thann mine. In the end, I feel the best way to repay the generosity is to
continue with open source development - just as the GSoC intended. Prior to
the GSoC, open source was simply an interesting concept to me, but
contributing a couple of thousands of lines of code to an open source codebase
has made me realise just how powerful open source is. There were no
restrictions on when I had to work (usually my productivity was at its peak at
outlandish late night hours), on the machine I used for coding (a trusty
IdeaPad, replaced with a much nicer ThinkPad), or on the place where I felt
most comfortable coding from (a toss up between my much used study table or
the living room). In many ways, working from home was probably the <em>best</em>
environment I could ask for when it came to working on this project. Hacking
on an open source project gave me a sense of gratification solving a problem
in competitive programming never could have.  </p>
<p>The Google Summer of Code may be over, but my journey with open source
development has just begun. Here’s to even bigger and better projects in the
future!</p>
