# Hi!

I'm **Arnav Dhamija**, and I work as a software engineer on autonomous vehicles at NVIDIA! Before this, I was an MSE Robotics student at the University of Pennsylvania. I enjoy talking about and looking at airplanes. My other hobbies are working on electronics projects, running, photography, and maintaining this blog.

I am better known as `shortstheory` online. You can read my [resume here](/static/arnav-dhamija.pdf)!
