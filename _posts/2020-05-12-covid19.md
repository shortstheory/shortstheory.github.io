The first time I heard of the coronavirus was on Jan 23 2020. A Chinese postdoc at a UPenn robotics lab I was planning to join was telling me about how a mysterious virus had been rapidly spreading through her home country. At the time, I vaguely remembered reading about a virus originating from Wuhan a couple of weeks back, so I made a mental note to check if the two viruses were related after the meeting. I later learned that the coronavirus originated from Wuhan. At the time, it seemed like a disease endemic to China and I put it out of mind till the end of February, when things started to get slightly more serious. Though the US only had a few cases at the time, it was quickly starting to become clear that the disease was a) no longer endemic to China and b) very contagious. I started obsessively refreshing coronavirus tracking dashboards, much like how I used to check cricket scores during the 2019 World Cup.


Two weeks later, the situation became. We got an email from UPenn on March 12, stating that the campus would be closed for good for the remainder of the semester. In hindsight, this was a prescient move, though at the time it felt like an overreaction. Things then spiralled out of control in front of my eyes. Day by day, the confirmed cases in the US kept mounting till it had overtaken Italy in less than ten days since I had received that fateful email from Penn. This was no longer something I could casually regard like cricket match scores or the weather. It had become something very real.


The last six weeks have been the hardest I have experienced in a long time. Graduate courses continued in flow, and although there were some concessions in the workload, the work that was there took much longer to finish. Motivation and productivity plummeted. It was amazing anything got done at all when you factor in the hours spent everyday checking for live updates on the virus. Cutting out my daily commute to campus was making me go *stir-crazy*. That said, I was seldom bored, for it's hard to be bored when you're stressed.


I am glad that I stumbled upon a Harvard Business Review article, [That Discomfort Youâ€™re Feeling Is Grief](https://hbr.org/2020/03/that-discomfort-youre-feeling-is-grief) as it helped me contextualize feeling something which I never had before. At the moment, I would say that I have reached a kind of wary acceptance with the current situation. However, I am still frustrated about several opportunities (including an internship!) and plans which are now shuttered because of the virus.


I have also been thinking about this virus on a more meta level. In no particular order, some of the things I have been thinking about are:

* In the last few years, there has been an increase in awareness about the deleterious effects of social media. Yet, now with life virtually online all the time, we are far more dependent on it than ever before. Will we see a rebound in the form of shunning social media once this is over? Or will the current level of consumption become the new normal?
* The American life could not be worse set up for dealing with a pandemic. In the USA, excessive consumption is a way of life and freedom is uncompromisable. The pandemic, on the other hand, necessitates frugality and strict impositions on personal movement.
* The speed at which awareness about COVID19 has spread is impressive. Yes, the media cherry picks reporting cases of people blatantly defying stay at home orders, but the general compliance of mask wearing and staying at home has been good.
* (More optimistically) As a budding roboticist, will the pandemic kickstart innovation in automation? Could we finally be seeing robots integrated in our daily lives in the next few years?
* I used to only have a passing interest in world news as I couldn't see how most of current affairs affected me. With this pandemic, I have become more acutely aware of current affairs.
* The pandemic has resulted in a large drop in vehicular emissions and air travel. The air quality in Indian metropolitan areas such as Bangalore and Delhi has never been better. Will this inspire environmentally friendly policies and increased usage of public transport in the long term?
* "Somebody is to Blame for This". It is much more satisfying to think that this is the product of some organizational failure than just a freak accident of a nature. Who can one blame? The CCP for suppressing news about the outbreak? The US government for botching the coronavirus response in the crucial first weeks of the pandemic? The WHO for its "noble lie" of suggesting that masks were ineffective in containing transmission? These failures will be case studies for future generations of what *not* to do during a health crisis.
* Many decisions I made during the start of the semester were not made considering a global pandemic on the horizon. Suffice to say, most of these decisions turned out to be the wrong ones.

The only thing worse than the pandemic itself would be if the world goes back to the status quo after it's over. This could be a good opportunity to see what really matters and how that should define policy-making decisions over the next decade.
