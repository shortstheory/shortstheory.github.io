The Pebble Cobbler is an annual gravel bike race held in Bakersfield, California. This year it was held on a cold morning on February 11. Participating in this race is right up there with the most crazy, most risky, most insane, and most exciting things I've ever done.

A gravel bike race is normally on fairly flat terrain with the most technical feature being loose gravel in the place of packed asphalt. But this race was anything but normal. This 85km course had as much as 1640m of elevation gain and several technical features which I would've felt nervous riding on a hardtail, let alone a gravel bike. There were sections where the climb became so steep that riding up was impossible and the only option was to push, if not carry, the bike. The descents could take you through beautiful green pastures one moment and through rollercoaster like berms the next. This ride was epic and I am so glad that I took the plunge to take part in it as my first bike race of some ever.

## What went well

### Finishing!

My only goal for this race. Despite almost bonking midway, I'm proud of myself for making it over every one of the hills on this ride.

### Gear

I am very happy with the choices I made with what I brought with me on this ride. I took my Giant Revolt 2 and swapped out the stock pedals for Race Face Chester MTB pedals with Adidas 5.10 Freerider MTB shoes to go along with it. I also invested in padded cycling shorts and a jersey for this race. Even the choice of bottle cages turned out to be crucial, for many cyclists lost their water bottles after flying over a bump. Every bit of cycling gear I got with me made the journey a little bit easier and it all helped getting me across the finish line.

### Logistics

Bakersfield is a fairly long drive from the Bay Area so I had to figure out my way there and a night's accomodation for the race. I originally planned to pick up my race packet the day before but heavy Friday afternoon traffic on the way to Bakersfield delayed my arrival by two hours. Fortunately I was able to pick up my race packet early morning on race day without a hitch.

## What didn't go well

### Training

My training for this race was badly hampered by all the rain in the Bay Area leading up to the race. Dry weekend days were nearly impossible to come by so I settled for doing 40-50km road rides when the rain wasn't too heavy. I also did a loop of Alameden Quicksilver on my gravel bike to get a better idea of how to handle the off-road descents on drop bars. Although these rides made me more comfortable with the length of the Pebble Cobbler, I had very little practice in dealing with the amount of elevation I encountered on the race day.

### Nutrition

I use energy bars filled with carbohydrates, protein, and fat for fueling myself for most of my longer bike rides. However, these do almost nothing for replinishing electrolytes and sodium levels. This nearly cost me the race had it not been for the packets of Lays classic chips at the second SAG (Support And Gear) station 50km in.


## The Race!!

Even at 85km and 5300 feet of elevation gain, the Pebble Cobbler is the little brother of the Rock Cobbler, a truely daunting course with 122km of mileage and 8100ft of elevation gain. Both the Pebbler Cobbler and the Rock Cobbler share the first 75km of madness, after which the Pebble Cobbler diverges to a bike trail back to the start whereas the Rock Cobbler has another 50km of challenges in store. This year, there were 750 cyclists taking part in the Rock Cobbler and 250 taking part in the shorter format. I was under the impression that the competition in the Pebble Cobbler is probably not quite as high as that found in the Rock Cobbler which would only draw the most hardcore of athletes.

### Sector 1 (0km to 25km)

The race started off in four waves ten minutes apart, with roughly 250 cyclists in each wave. The Rock Cobbler had three of the four starting waves, with the Pebble Cobbler only having one. The start was jam-packed and it took a full minute before there was enough space that I could start pedalling. The race started off on a two-way paved bike trail going by the Kern river. This was my first time riding in a group and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to cruise at 30+km/hr on the flat ground in this section. After a brief hill climb and descent, the off-road section started out with a steep climb! Several people opted to push their bikes on this section but I was feeling great so I decided to power through all the climbs. The doubletrack descent which followed was smooth and easy, a great way to warm up before the gnarly sections which came later in the day. Before I knew it, I came across the first SAG stop and I stopped for a few minutes to replinish my food and water supplies. I also needed to adjust my seatpost's bolt, or else I would have to contend with the seatpost sliding down into the frame on its own. The Cobbler is famous for mini challenges during the race and at the first SAG stop, the challenge was to ride over a fire pit for...posterity?!

### Sector 2 (25km to 50km)

Riding off the high of this being my first race, I got to the 40km mark in 2hrs13mins wall time and I was feeling pretty good about my pacing at that point. My map indicated that I would need to brace myself for two big hills at 42km and
