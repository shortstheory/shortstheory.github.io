The months of quarantine have been exhausting in every single way. One of the sources of light in this unfamiliar tunnel of social isolation has been my new bicycle, on which I have already completed over 1200km in the three odd months of owning it. Philadelphia has relatively flat elevation, good bike lane coverage, and many beautiful trails making it a great city for cycling. These are some of my favourite spots for cycling in and around Philadelphia.

### Ben Franklin Bridge / Penn's Landing

A famous landmark of Philadelphia, the Ben Franklin bridge links the city to Camden, New Jersey. The bridge is flanked by a shared walkway/bike path on both sides, though only the right walkway is presently open. Getting to the highest point of the middle of the bridge can be a drag (and nearly impossible to do when riding a fixed-gear cycle), but it's certainly worth it for the sea breeze and views of the Delaware river and the skyline of Philadelphia. One can also hear and feel the vibrations of the NJ Transit train right below the walkway.

The Camden Waterfront and the Rutgers Law School are the main attractions on the other side of the bridge. I also stumbled across a floating battleship museum moored on my first trip to the Waterfront.

I personally find Race Street the safest way to go to the Ben Franklin Bridge when starting from the Art Museum. The transition in scenery and smells from the Ben Franklin Parkway to Chinatown is very enjoyable. The Spruce Street corridor makes it easy to go back with the bollards lining the bike path for additional safety.

### Manayunk Trail

This trail starts right next to the Trek Manayunk showroom, which is a short ride from the East Falls bridge. The initial section of the trail consists of wooden boardwalks and some light gravel, before turning into miles upon miles of paved, treelined roads running parallel to the Manayunk canal. The trail is mostly flat and this makes it easy to cover long stretches of the trail in quick time. There are only a few greater pleasures than being able to squeeze out 30km/hr in top gear for several kilometers. Though I've only made it as far as Bridgeport, the trail goes on till the Valley Forge National Park. A 100km round-trip on this trail is on my bucket list.
