This semester has gone a *little* too fast for my liking. Though there were plenty of good memories and takeaways from this semester, it has been by far my most stressful time in this college yet. Between taking on a number of technical projects and trying to rescue a sharply falling SG due to a poor T1, there has been very little free time this sem. Above all, this sem has shown me just how limited of a resource brain power is. Thinking about solving problems wears me out much more easily than it used to.

That\'s not to say what I\'ve been doing is all drudgery. Some interesting projects that I\'ve been working on:

### GSoC 2016 Project - kio-stash

Yup, this [project](https://github.com/KDE/kio-stash) has been in the pipeline for months. While it (mostly) works on a clean install of KDE, it has some bugs with copying with mtp:/ device slaves and isn\'t very well integrated with Dolphin yet. It is in my best interest to have this shipped with KDE Frameworks as soon as possible, so I\'m looking into patching Dolphin with better, more specific action support for my project.

### IEEE Signal Processing Cup 2017 - Real-Time Beat Tracking Challenge

The premise of this project doesn\'t seem very complicated - a team just needs to submit an algorithm which can successfully detect the beats in a song in real-time on an embedded device. Heck, I had already implemented the same on an Arduino with a microphone for rather [fancy lighting in my hostel room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMb1XScNgOs). Unfortunately, as I\'ve learned the hard way, anything that looks simple is deceptive and this project is a perfect example. For one thing, a song by itself in the amplitude-time domain is nearly impossible to extract any data from, so it requires a (Fast) Fourier Transform to extract frequency bin amplitudes to get anything useful from it. Next, obtaining beat onset and detection requires generating a tempogram to find the BPM of a song to find the approximate beat positions. There are many interesting approaches and different algorithms to solve this problem. Fortunately, I\'m not doing this alone and the seniors I\'m working with have a better understanding of the more difficult mathematical components of this project, leaving me free to code in C++ and deploy it on actual hardware.

### foss@bphc

This project is a society on campus I started with [three](https://github.com/aero31aero/)[programmers](https://github.com/TestSubjector) [far]([https://github.com/Nischay-](https://github.com/Nischay-) Pro/) more competent than myself. It all started in September this year when we had the two-day long [Wikimedia Hackathon](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Hackathon_BPHC) on campus. Though my contribution to Wikimedia was small, I got a lot out of the hackathon by meeting the people from Amrita University who came for organising the event. Listening to what [Tony](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:01tonythomas) and [Srijan](http://srijanagarwal.me/) had to say about how much working for foss@amrita had benefited them made me realise how much room for improvement there was in BPHC. As far as this society goes, things are still in their infancy, yet I feel there is just enough critical mass of talent and enthusiasm in open source development to push this society forward. We even have our own [Constitution](https://fossbphc.github.io/docs/constitution.html)!

### Making a personal website?

While Blogspot has been a faithful home for this blog for over half a decade, it is time to move to a modern solution for hosting. Plus setting up a website will teach me a bit about web development too, and I\'ve needed an excuse to learn it for a while. Surely it can\'t be all that hard, right?

### Burnout

While the slew of all these technical projects seemed like a good idea at the time, it has pushed me closer to burning out. It is the same feeling as what I felt the same time last year, albeit for different reasons.

Some of it has carried over from studying harder at the end of this sem than I had done so before. To my surprise, studying under pressure was actually more effective than it was without. In some ways, it was a throwback to studying for the number of exams nearly a couple of years ago. It has made me question whether any of my education was as much for the knowledge as it was for the desperation of avoiding failure. I still haven\'t figured it out, but at least I feel like I\'m not as adverse to putting in the hours for getting a decent CGPA as I had been last semester.

There have been compromises in other spheres of college life as well, investing so much time in studying or doing projects has made me cut down my participation in other clubs and I\'ve quit nearly all the non-technical clubs I joined last year. There\'s more than that too - I feel it\'s much harder to be fully immersed in anything anymore.

Maybe it\'s just something else which requires more soul searching.
