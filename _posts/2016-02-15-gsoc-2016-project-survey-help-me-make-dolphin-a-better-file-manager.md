Hey everyone!

I am a first year computer science undergraduate from BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. I am looking forward to working for KDE for the GSoC.

![](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/downloads/GSoC2016Logo.jpg)

My project idea is based on solving a problem all file managers have had for years - the lack of an easy to use file selection tool. My project aims to simplify selecting files from multiple directory trees.

I am running a survey to gauge community feedback on my idea and to finalize the user interface and features list.

The link to my idea proposal can be found here: [https://goo.gl/1Nj4SY](https://goo.gl/1Nj4SY)

And the link to my survey can be found here: [https://goo.gl/forms/5JSZXNganX](https://goo.gl/forms/5JSZXNganX)

TIA for the feedback : )
