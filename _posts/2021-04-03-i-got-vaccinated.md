I am happy to announce that as of 905am, April 3 2021, I am part of a rapidly increasing COVID19 statistic - the number of people vaccinated from the disease!

*The time in top-right corner of the vaccine document is the time at which I could safely leave after observing a 15 minute wait period for side effects*

I was able to get the Janssen/J&J single dose vaccine a bit earlier than expected by getting a callback from Walmart's leftover vaccine waitlist and I am absolutely delighted to receive this particular vaccine. On the drive back from Walmart, I had Vampire Weekend's [Harmony Hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlkTVMMkCP4) (a song which I had played on repeat for much of 2020) playing on the car's stereo and I felt a surge of positivity that I had been missing for a long time.

I experienced some pretty strong side-effects from the J&J vaccine with chills, a headache, and a fever which reminded me of what bad viral fevers used to feel like after not having gotten sick in over a year. I had an ibuprofen when the symptoms started to get worse and by the next morning, the fever was gone and I was feeling a little weak, but otherwise pretty normal. It was definitely the strongest reaction I've ever had to a vaccine, but it's totally worth it.

I think the biggest positive impact on being fully vaccinated in two weeks will be the added peace of mind in knowing that social decisions can be made with without the mental gymnastics we all used to think through in 2020. It might take a little longer for things to really open back up in the US, but till then, this vaccine will make the ride a lot smoother. Vaccines for my demographic and area are still hard to come by, but fortunately it looks like that will change quickly in the next few weeks when general eligibility opens.


<!-- Back in April 2020, it was hard to stomach that the way life had changed in the weeks following March 2020 would be here to stay for good. News sites started pushing a dismal narrative with endless articles about the "new normal" and record case counts that were almost sure to be broken the very next day. There was little to suggest back then that there would ever be a semblance of what life was like in 2019 ever again. -->

<!-- All this went on until I came across an article on April #TODO about an experimental COVID-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University which was successful in reducing COVID-19's severe symptoms to something resembling a mere head cold in macaques. From that dayon, updating myself on the latest in COVID vaccine development became a daily ritual that would last for many mnths to come. I started to tell anyone who would listen that the vaccines would be coming sooner than we think and would be our ticket out of the pandemic. As units of time blended into one another - days to weeks and then later to months, it felt like that the efficacy results of the Phase 3 trials of the vacciens could not come soon enough. Finally, in November 2020, we got to see the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine's efficacy readout, followed shortly by the results of other forerunning vaccine candidates from companies such as Moderna, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Janssen, and Novavax. The vaccines were promptly granted an Emergency Use Authorization and deployed on an unprecedented size and scale worldwide. There was finall -->
