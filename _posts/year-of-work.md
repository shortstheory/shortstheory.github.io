It's funny how something as natural as the progression of time still catches me by surprise. Nowadays, I frequently catch myself thinking that it was only last year I had freshly graduated from UPenn and left the student life behind me. It also takes me by surprise that it took me over this long before I started working a full-time job at a 'real' company. Living in the Bay Area and working full time has its benefits and downsides below:

+ moneyyyyy

Yes, the cost of rent in the Bay Area is high. But tech jobs in the Bay Area pay *really* well given my living expenses. More than anything, I feel like I've finally graduated from the student life when I don't flinch at paying for a $15 entree. In the US, money gives you freedom and I feel like I've had more freedom living here than I've ever had before. 

+ learned to contribute meaningfully to a big company

I never worked at a 'real' company before I joined NVIDIA. Even coding collaboratively was new to me when I joined as all my projects before working at NVIDIA were solo projects under a mentor. As opposed to personal projects where I handled the design and implementation, I've noticed that it's quite different to work on a smaller part of a big project where the scope of new designs is smaller. I've learned a lot about writing better C++ code and even picked up a little bit of CUDA for prototyping parts of our code on the GPU.

My first year of working at NVIDIA can be divided into two distinct chapters - the part where I worked from home all the time and the current chpater where I'm in the office everyday. Working from home felt alienating in the beginning and I frequently questioned myself if this is what I've wanted since forever. With no company-wide events in 2021, it barely even felt like I was working for a major company. I used to remark that WFH felt like going to a party where you can only watch others through the door's keyhole.

Things have definitely changed for the better since the campus opened this year. I am much happier to go through the routine of getting ready and commuting compared to spending all day at home. The office is still mostly empty but I've made new lunch buddies and climbing partners along the way, which brings me too...

+ climbing

+ more extroverted now
+ picked up climbing
+ feels like life is recovering some balance now
+ glad to have great friends nearby
+ prettiest views ever
+ trips in summer
- realized high maintenance lifestyle actually requires maintenance
- dating?
- unsustainable rebound after COVID
- became uncomfortable being alone
- hard to maintain multiple hobbies tbh
- forming deep connections and friends is rarer

Feeling settled is what I'm working towards. Stuff no longer happens to you.

It's made me more reflective on a year gone by and I've started to notice the cracks in my lifestyle soon after returning from Philadelphia. 

High maintenance lifestyle.

In my last post, I briefly mentioned how I felt like life in the Bay Area felt devoid of contentment.
