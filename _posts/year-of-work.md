It's funny how something as natural as the progression of time still catches me by surprise. Nowadays, I frequently catch myself thinking that it was only last year I had freshly graduated from UPenn and left the student life behind me. It also takes me by surprise that it took me over this long before I started working a full-time job at a 'real' company. Living in the Bay Area and working full time has its benefits and downsides below:

+ moneyyyyy

Yes, the cost of rent in the Bay Area is high. But tech jobs in the Bay Area pay *really* well given my living expenses. More than anything, I feel like I've finally graduated from the student life when I don't flinch at paying for a $15 entree. In the US, money gives you freedom and I feel like I've had more freedom living here than I've ever had before. 

+ learned to contribute meaningfully to a big company

I never worked at a 'real' company before I joined NVIDIA. Even coding collaboratively was new to me when I joined as all my projects before working at NVIDIA were solo projects under a mentor. As opposed to personal projects where I handled the design and implementation, I've noticed that it's quite different to work on a smaller part of a big project where the scope of new designs is smaller. I've learned a lot about writing better C++ code and even picked up a little bit of CUDA for prototyping parts of our code on the GPU.

My first year of working at NVIDIA can be divided into two distinct chapters - the part where I worked from home all the time and the current chpater where I'm in the office everyday. Working from home felt alienating in the beginning and I frequently questioned myself if this is what I've wanted since forever. With no company-wide events in 2021, it barely even felt like I was working for a major company. I used to remark that WFH felt like going to a party where you can only watch others through the door's keyhole.

Things have definitely changed for the better since the campus opened this year. I am much happier to go through the routine of getting ready and commuting compared to spending all day at home. The office is still mostly empty but I've made new lunch buddies and climbing partners along the way, which brings me to my next point about...

+ climbing

After spending a few hours in a climbing gym, it's easy to see why indoor rock climbing is so popular among Bay Area techbros. The climbing routes (called problems) tickles the same parts of my brain as doing LeetCode does. Problems are graded on a scale by difficulty. Some problems require special moves. And you're constrained by the time you have to solve a problem by how much your fingers and forearms can take before you find yourself getting more familiar with the climbing pad than the top of the wall. 

The graded progression in problem difficulty in climbing gives me a lot of motivation to keep at it. I love that it's a good workout while barely feeling like one. I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the indoor rock climbing community is very inclusive. I've found that discussing the beta is one of the best ways to strike up conversation and make friends with complete strangers.

+ more extroverted now

I feel like 2020 really did a number on my social skills. When the world was slowly opening back up again, I felt like I was starting afresh. 

+ Settling

I didn't realize it at the time, but my first year in the Bay Area was a process in getting more *settled*. I used to hate the term, because I used to conflate settling with slowing down. I found staying at home difficult in the beginning - for it was the last thing I wanted to do after a year of online masters and a WFH job. I've come to realize that settling is feeling more secure in your lifestyle. 

 It's about being more sure about where you want to be in this stage of life. Getting settled is a process which I never payed much attention to in Hyderabad, Singapore, or Philadelphia, because I always had it at the back of my mind that I would be moving eventually. It's different now as the habits I form now are going to stick for much longer. To this end, I've been working on scheduling appointments, keeping track of chores, and maintaining a personal kanban board for things I want to accomplish in two week intervals. One of the most effective tricks I've tried implementing is to resolve the daily sources of friction I used to put up with at the very moment I identify it.
 
 Working from the office has helped bring some balance to life and has restored the home to a place meant for rest. 

+ picked up climbing
+ feels like life is recovering some balance now
+ glad to have great friends nearby
+ prettiest views ever
+ trips in summer
- realized high maintenance lifestyle actually requires maintenance
- dating?
- unsustainable rebound after COVID
- became uncomfortable being alone
- hard to maintain multiple hobbies tbh
- forming deep connections and friends is rarer

Feeling settled is what I'm working towards. Stuff no longer happens to you.

It's made me more reflective on a year gone by and I've started to notice the cracks in my lifestyle soon after returning from Philadelphia. 

High maintenance lifestyle.

In my last post, I briefly mentioned how I felt like life in the Bay Area felt devoid of contentment.
