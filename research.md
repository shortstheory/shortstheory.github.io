### 2019

*"Disruption Tolerant Networks for Underwater Communications"* - This was the topic of my undergraduate thesis. I worked at the wonderful [Acoustic Research Laboratory](https://arl.nus.edu.sg/twiki6/bin/view/ARL/WebHome) (ARL) at NUS, Singapore under [Prof. Mandar Chitre](http://www.chitre.net/). I developed a new `UnetAgent` which could utilise other `LINK` agents for achieving disruption tolerant communication. I presented this project to the ARL on 25 April 2019 and this presentation can be found below.

### 2018

*"VECTORS â€” VidEo Communication Through Opportunistic Relays and Scalable video coding"* - This is a project on Disruption Tolerant Networks which I did in my third year at BITS Hyderabad. I worked with Mr. Abhishek Thakur and a senior, Tejashwer Reddy and made an Android app which could make Android phones automatically connect to one another to transfer SVC encoded video data. In December 2018, we published a paper on this project in the Elsevier SoftwareX journal.
