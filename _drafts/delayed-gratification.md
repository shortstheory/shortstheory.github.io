Since my last post on [COVID19](/2020/05/12/on-covid19/), I have experienced a curious change in my relation to work. My attention span is far less than it what it used to be and there is a considerable drop in productivity as well. It isn't just my work which is affected, for I wasn't even able to bring myself to type out this blog post for nearly a week after creating the file. I have tried making progressive steps, such as cutting off the flow of mental junk food of social media, but it seems like losing time on social media was only a small part of the problem.

Of course, all this is going on with the COVID19 pandemic and heightened racial tensions in the background. These alone seem to be sufficient reason for why it's hard to mentally stay on top of things. However, I feel another possible reason for this is that it is harder to find gratification in work anymore. Without the social contact, work feels impersonal and uninspiring. In normal circumstances, a difficult technical problem is an exciting thing to work on, but now it just feels like a mental burden. I have also realized I'm much more willing to work on short term tasks with immediate goals than something which could take weeks to complete. 

Wikipedia defines [delayed gratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gratification) as:

> Delayed gratification, or deferred gratification, describes the process that the subject undergoes when the subject resists the temptation of an immediate reward in preference for a later reward.

(A famous experiment, usually cited in the same breath as this topic, is the Stanford Marshmallow experiment)
