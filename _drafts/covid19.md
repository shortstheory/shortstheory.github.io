The first time I heard of the coronavirus was on Jan X 2020. A Chinese postdoc at a UPenn robotics lab I was planning to join was telling me about how a mysterious virus had been rapidly spreading through her home country. At the time, I vaguely remembered reading about a virus originating from Wuhan a couple of weeks back, so I made a mental note to check if the two viruses were related after the meeting. I later learned that the coronavirus originated from Wuhan. At the time, it seemed like a disease endemic to China and I put it out of mind till the end of February, when things started to get slightly more serious. Though the US only had a few cases at the time, it was quickly starting to become clear that the disease was a) no longer endemic to China and b) very contagious. I started obsessively refreshing coronavirus tracking dashboards, much like how I used to check cricket scores during the 2019 World Cup.


Two weeks later, shit hit the fan. We got an email from UPenn on March X, stating that the campus would be closed for good for the remainder of the semester. In hindsight, this was a prescient move, though at the time it felt like an overreaction. Things then spiralled out of control in front of my eyes. Day by day, the confirmed cases in the US kept mounting till it had overtaken Italy in less than ten days since I had received that fateful email from Penn. This was no longer something I could casually regard like cricket match scores or the weather. It had become something very real.


The last six weeks have been the hardest I have experienced in a long time. Graduate courses continued in flow, and although there were some concessions in the workload, the work that was there took much longer to finish. Motivation and productivity plummeted. It was amazing anything got done at all when you factor in the hours spent everyday checking for live updates on the virus. Cutting out my daily commute to campus was making me go *stir-crazy*. That said, I was seldom bored, for it's hard to be bored when you're stressed.


I am glad that I stumbled upon a Harvard Business Review article, [That Discomfort Youâ€™re Feeling Is Grief](https://hbr.org/2020/03/that-discomfort-youre-feeling-is-grief) as it helped me contextualize feeling something which I never had before. At the moment, I would say that I have reached a kind of wary acceptance with the current situation. However, I am still frustrated about several opportunities (including an internship!) and plans which are now shuttered because of the virus.


I have also been thinking about this virus on a more meta level. In no particular order, some of the things I have been thinking about are:

* In the last few years, there has been an increase in awareness about the deleterious effects of social media. Yet, now with life virtually online all the time, we are far more dependent on it than ever before. Will we see a rebound in the form of shunning social media once this is over? Or will the current level of consumption become the new normal?
* The American life could not be worse set up for dealing with a pandemic. Excessive consumption is a way of life and freedom is uncompromisable. The pandemic 
* (More optimistically) As a budding roboticist, will the pandemic kickstart innovation in automation? Could we finally be seeing robots integrated in our daily lives in the next few years?
