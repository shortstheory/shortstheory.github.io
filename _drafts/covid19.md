The first time I heard of the coronavirus was on Jan X 2020. A Chinese postdoc at a UPenn robotics lab I was planning to join was telling me about how a mysterious virus had been rapidly spreading through her home country. At the time, I vaguely remembered reading about a virus originating from Wuhan a couple of weeks back, so I made a mental note to check if the two viruses were related after the meeting. I later learned that the coronavirus originated from Wuhan. At the time, it seemed like a disease endemic to China and I put it out of mind till the end of February, when things started to get slightly more serious. Though the US only had a few cases at the time, it was quickly starting to become clear that the disease was a) no longer endemic to China and b) very contagious. I started obsessively refreshing coronavirus tracking dashboards, much like how I used to check cricket scores during the 2019 World Cup.


Two weeks later, shit hit the fan. We got an email from UPenn on March X, stating that the campus would be closed for good for the remainder of the semester. In hindsight, this was a prescient move, though at the time it felt like an overreaction. Things then spiralled out of control in front of my eyes. Day by day, the confirmed cases in the US kept mounting till it had overtaken Italy in less than ten days since I had received that fateful email from Penn. This was no longer something I could casually regard like cricket match scores or the weather. It had become something very real.
