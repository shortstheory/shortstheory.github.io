The first time I heard of the coronavirus was on Jan X 2020. A Chinese postdoc at a UPenn robotics lab I was planning to join was telling me about how a mysterious virus had been rapidly spreding through her home country. At the time, I vaguely remembered reading about a virus originating from Wuhan a couple of weeks back, so I made a mental note to check if the two viruses were related after the meeting. I later learned that the coronavirus originated from Wuhan. At the time, it seemed like a disease endemic to China and I put it out of mind till the end of February, when things started to get slightly more serious. Though the US only had a few cases at the time, it was quickly starting to become clear that the disease was a) no longer endemic to China and b) very contagious.
